Abstract-The mechanical properties of 3 types of cellular solids (flexible, plastic and brittle) have been
measured as a function of density. The results are compared with models for the stiffness, strength and
densification; and constitutive laws are developed. Data and models for each type of cellular solid are
combined to develop mechun&n-mode mq~ which summarise the properties in a single diagram; this
understanding, in turn, allows the construction of energy ubsorpfion diagrams for classes of foams. Natural
cellular materials fit the same pattern; maps are presented, as an example, for wood. The maps help in
design and in the selection of the optimal foam for a given load-bearing or energy-absorbing application.

1. INTRODUCTION
Polymeric foams have certain characteristic mechan-
ical properties. Elastomeric or flexible foams, in
simple compression, are linear-elastic to a strain of
about 5%. Then the cell walls buckle and the foam
collapses at a nearly constant stress (giving a non-
linear elastic deformation) until the cell walls touch
and the stress-strain curve rises steeply. Rigid poly-
men and metals, when foamed, have a similar
stress-strain curve, but for a different reason. Like
flexible foams, they are linear-elastic to a strain of
roughly 5%. Then they suffer plastic collapse, com-
pressing plastically at a nearly constant stress until
the cell walls touch, and the stress-strain curve rises
steeply. Brittle foams, too, show an initial linear-
elastic regime. But when the stress is reached at which
cell walls fracture, the stress-strain curve becomes
irregular (though roughly horizontal) and the foam
crushes at (roughly) constant load.
ton leave from I.T.T., Bombay,
India.
Figure 1 shows, schematically, the structure of
cellular solids. Some have open cells: the solid
material is distributed as little beams which form the
cell edges. Others have closed ceils: the solid is
distributed as little plates which form the cell faces.
The mechanical properties reflect, to some extent, this
distribution. In practice, most man-made foams (even
those with closed cells faces) behave as if they had
open cells because surface tension draws much of the
solid material into the cell-edges during manufacture.
For this reason, we discuss open-cell foams in detail,
but treat closed cell foams only in passing.
The mechanical properties of a cellular solid can be
related to the mechanics of bending, buckling, plastic
collapse and brittle fracture of its cell walls. Each part
of the stress-strain curve can be modelled [l-4]. The
models give equations for Young’s modulus E*, the
elastic buckling stress af, the plastic collapse stress
as, the crushing strength uf, and terminal rise in
strength, in terms of the density and properties of the
material of which the foam is made.

This paper seeks to test and extend these models,
(checking them against data from literature and new
data, described below), to derive constitutive laws for
design with cellular solids, and to develop diagrams
which summarise the overall mechanical response of
each type. Symbols are defined in Table 1.

RESULTS
2.1. Foamed plastics and ceramics
We also tested a number of woods, chosen to give
a range of relative densities between 0.05 and 0.5.
Samples
of
well-seasoned
woods,
roughly
20mm x 20 mm x 40 mm, were cut with the long
direction parallel to a radius of the trunk and parallel
to the axis of the trunk. The samples were stored for
10 days to reach equilibrium moisture content
(roughly 12%) and tested in compresssion at 18°C
and a strain rate close to 10m3/s. Results are shown
in Figs 7 and 8.
We tested samples of commercial flexible foams (a
polyethylene and a polyurethane), samples of a
commercial rigid foam (a polymethacrylimid) and
an experimental batch of a brittle ceramic foam
(mullite). The materials, their origins and the proper-
ties of the cell walls are listed in Table 2. Their
structures are shown in Fig. 2.
Compression tests were carried out on blocks of
foam of a convenient size (the size depending on the
stiffness), at a temperature of 18°C and a strain-rate
of roughly 2 x 10-‘/s. Results are shown in Figs 3-6.
The axes are the nominal stress (the load P divided

When a cellular material is compressed, the cell
walls deform. The deformation modes (bending,
buckling, plastic .collapse and fracture) are known
from studies of model cells [2]. Two-dimensional
models (shown in insets of subsequent figures) can be
analysed aautrately [2]. With this knowledge, a kind
‘of dimensional analysis of Zdimensional

small loads. Section 3.3, below, explains the power
of ‘R.)
Poissons ratios v have been measured for cellular
solids [I, 31. In the linear-elastic regime, v x j,
although in the plateau regime it is almost zero.
3.2. Elaslic buckling
Flexible foams show extensive non-linear elasticity.
It is caused by the elastic buckling of the cell walls
[8, 181, as shown in the inset of Fig. 10, and it is this
that gives the plateau of the stress-strain curve for
elastomeric foams.
The critical load at which a column of length I,
Young’s modulus IZ, and second moment of area I
buckles, is given by Euler’s formula:
If this load is reached for a layer of cells spanning the
section, they buckle, initiating the elastic collapse of
the foam. For the 3-dimensional open-cell foam of
Fig. 1 the stress uf at which this occurs is propor-
tional to F,/l’. Using the facts that I a I’ and

It is valid for relative densities below 0.3. At higher
densities, the cell walls are too short and stocky to
buckle; instead they yield or crush.
Data for 6:: for elastomeric foams are compared
with equation (8) in Fig, 10. They are well fitted by
the equation with C, = 0.05.
3.3. Plmic

If the cell-wall material yields plastically, as do
metals and many polymers, then the foam as a whole
shows a plateau caused by plastic collapse. It occurs
when the moment on the inclined cell walls exceeds
the fully plastic moment, creating plastic hinges
[2,3,19,20] as shown in the inset of Fig. 1I. For a
beam of square section of side t, the fully plastic
moment is
MP =fu/.
(9)
The moment is proportional to Fi, and (as before) the
force F is proportional to tr12. Combining these
results with equation (5) we find the plastic collapse,

Brittle foams (ceramics, and certain rigid polymers)

Let tbe modulus of rupture (the maximum surface or
skin stress at the instant of fracture) for the cell-wall
material be c,. Then a cell wall will fail as shown in

The limited experimental data, shown in Fig. 12,
are consistent with C, = 0.65 but are insufficient to
give much more confidence in equation (11). But
observations, reviewed elsewhere [4], suggest that the
model has the correct physical basis, and we shall
employ it in subsequent sections.
3.5. Demification and the shape of the stress-strain
curve
The plateau ends when the folding cell walls begin
to touch. During elastic buckling or plastic collapse,
the foam compresses axially with almost no lateral
spreading (v RI 0). Then simple geometry gives the

Consider now the shape of the stress-strain curve

plateau starts when a layer of cells (those with
longest, or most favourably oriented, edges) buckle

cause more cell edges (those which are slightly
shorter) to buckle. We postulate that the length of the

The argument of Section 3.2 can now be repeated.
The force F on the cell wall is related to lo throughout
the test by F = a ii. Collapse of cells with edge length
I(E) [given by equation (16)] occurs when this force
exceeds the buckling load given by equation (7).
Combining these equations gives
This reduces to equation (10) at small strains, but
becomes infinite (approximating E,) as the foam is
compressed to the solid density [equation (13)].
These two results give an approximate description
of the stress-strain curves for flexible and for rigid-
plastic foams, in the fields of plastic collapse and
densification. They are combined with the equations
for linear-elasticity, in the next sections, to construct
deformation-mode
maps and energy-absorption
diagrams.
4. CONSTRUCTION OF DEFORMATION-MODE
MAPS
We have seen that when an elastomeric foam is
compressed, it first deforms in a linear-elastic way;
then its cells buckle to give non-linear elasticity; and,
finally, the cells collapse completely and the stress
rises rapidly as their faces and edges are forced
together. A plastic foam behaves in a somewhat
similar way, except that linear elasticity is now fol-
lowed by plastic collapse, and the ultimate forcing
together of the cell walls. With brittle foams,
progressive crushing can again lead to a plateau
which ends when the material is completely crushed.
We have seen, too, that each of these processes can
be modelled adequately by using classical beam the-
ory to analyse the deformation of cell walls. The
analysis relates foam properties to the relative density
(p/p,) and to the properties of the material of which
the foam is made. The relations, summa&d in Table
4, suggest a normalisation which brings the properties
of foams with the same relative densities into coin-
cidence. Then the properties of an entire family of
foams can be shown as a deformation mode map (4).
of which Figs 13-16 are examples. The map has axes
of norrnalised compressive stress a/E,, and the com-
pressive strain E. It shows the jeluk in which each
mode of deformation (linear elasticity, non-linear
elasticity, plastic collapse and so forth) is dominant.
Superimposed on the fields are stress-strain contours
for constant (initial) relative density.
4.1. Elastomeric foams
which reduces to our original equation (8) at small
strains, but becomes infinite (approximating E,) at
the strain given by equation (13).
A similar analysis can be made for plastic foams.
We postulate that the length of the beams which are
about to bend plastically decreases as strain proceeds
(because the long ones bend first). If the length at a
strain E is given (as before) by equation (16), then by
Figures 13 and 14 show mechanism-mode maps for
elastomeric foams. Figure 13 shows the experimental
stress-strain curves for polymeric foams; Fig. 14 is
based on the theory alone. Mechanism field bound-
aries (heavy lines) are shown on both figures. They
were constructed as follows.
The linear-elastic regime ends when elastic buck-
ling begins. Using equations (6) and (8), and the fact
that 0 = EC in the linear-elastic region, we obtain the

Once elastic buckling starts, the stress is related to

It is plotted as a heavy line, sloping down from left

Figure 14 shows a theoretical map. The contours
are stress-strain curves for foams of relative density
between 0.01 and 0.4. They show a linear elastic
regime [equation (a)] and a plateau corresponding
to elastic buckling; they start to bend upwards
when densification starts [equation (1711; and they
approach a limiting slope of E, when densification is
complete [equation (13)]. Within the field of elastic
buckling the material exists in two states at almost the
same stress (the linear-elastic state and the densified
state); it is like the p-V response of an ideal gas (or
the temperature-entropy
diagram for steam) in which
gas and liquid stat4 can co-exist. The material
deforms by the formation of densified bands which
thicken, at constant stress, as the strain is increased,
until the entire material has reached the dense state.
The figure describes the overall response of all
isotropic, flexible foams in compression. In tension,
flexible foams are roughly linear-elastic to rupture.

Plastic foams, like the elastic ones, show three
plastic collapse and
regions: linear elasticity,
densification-though

The figure shows the overall response of isotropic,
plastic foams in compression. It is less general than
the map for elastomeric foams because it must be
constructed for a particular value of u,/E,. But the
equations show that the boundaries are not very
sensitive to its value, and, for a given material, the
diagram shows the behaviour for all densities.

4.3. Brittle foams
Rigid foams show linear-elastic behaviour to frac-
ture. In compression, the foam crushes at constant
stress [equation (1 I)], and since the crushing equation
has the same form as that for plastic collapse, the
behaviour will resemble that of Figs I5 and 16. If the
foam is contained, it will densify at the strain given
approximately by equation (18), with by/E, replaced
by e,lE.<.
In tension, linear elastic behaviour is truncated by
fast, brittle fracture. The fracture mechanics of foams
[28] need not concern us here.

These ideas can be applied, in an approximate way,
to the compressive deformation of wood. Woods are
cellular solids, composed of mixed polymers (cellu-
lose, lignin, hemicellulose), and with a relative density
ranging from less than 0.05 (balsas) to almost I
(lignum vitae). Compressed across the grain, wood
behaves like a rigid-plastic foam. Stress-strain curves
for the woods we tested are shown in Fig. 17, plotted
on axes of a/E., and E (data in Tables 2 and 3).
The field boundaries of Fig. 17 were constructed as
follows. In radial compression, Young’s modulus for
woods is found to follow the same law as elastic
foams (29)

Then the equation of the line separating elastic and
collapse behaviour is
E = 0.004.
When woods are compressed axially, they collapse by
a process which involves the kinking (301 or fracture
[29,30] of the cell walls. This occurs at essentially
co~~~hrnfstress until a critical state is reached, when
the stress-strain
curve bends sharply upwards.
Experimentally, we find that the bend upwards
occurs at a strain E, corresponding to a density of

5. CONSTRUCTION OF ENERGY-ABSORPTION
DlAGRAMS
The commonest use of foams is in packaging. The
aim is to absorb energy (usually the kinetic energy)
of the packaged object when it is dropped, or is
accelerated or decelerated in some other way, while
at the same time keeping the force on the object
below the limit which will cause damage. In selecting
a material for the package, we need to know the
energy that can be absorbed without the stress
exceeding a critical value. We show below that there
is an optimum foam density for a given package. If

The field boundaries divide the behaviour into 3
regimes and give a diagram which summarises the
properties of all woods in radial compression.
Compression along the grain is more complicated.
In this direction, the wood has properties inter-
mediate between those of a rigid-plastic and a brittle
cellular solid (compare the stress-strain curves of Fig.
8 with those of Figs 5 and 6). In axial compression,
Young’s modulus varies linearly with density [29,30]

the density is too low, the foam “bottoms out” (with
a sharp increase in stress) before enough energy has
been absorbed. If it is too dense, the stress exceeds the
critical value before enough energy has been
absorbed.

for a foam. It is linear-elastic to ~0, and thereafter

density is important: it can easily give a factor of 10
greater absorption of energy than a wrongly-chosen
foam.
Figures 21 and 22 show energy diagrams for a
plastic foam with u,/E, = 0. I. Such diagrams are less
general than those for elastic foams, because uJE,
must be specified; but a single diagram still describes
all foams made of a given material (polystyrene, for
example). Here, too, there is an optimum foam
density for a given energy absorption and peak stress.
The diagram allows it to be chosen.
The figures show that, for a given material (and
thus E,), there is a maximum energy which can be
absorbed for a given peak stress. The envelope shown
as a broken line on Figs 19 and 21 divides the
diagram into an accessible region (below the line) and
an inaccessible one (above). For elastomeric foams,

6. CONCLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS
6.1. Conclusions
When a cellular solid with a relative density below
0.30 is compressed, it shows a stress-strain curve with
three parts: a linear-elastic part, a long plateau, and
a regime of final densification. The properties of an
entire class of such solids can be summa&d

This equation was integrated using equation (I 7) for
u(s) for elastic foams and equation (18) for plastic
foams, to give Figs I9 and 2 1. Similar diagrams can,
of course, be constructed directly from the experi-
mental stress-strain curves (such as those shown in
Figs 34) by measuring the area W/E, up to the strain
E+ corresponding to the stress u/E,. Such diagrams
are shown, for comparison, in Figs 20 and 22.
The energy diagram, calculated for elastic foams
(Fig. 19) shows the normalised energy absorbed per
unit volume for foam, W/E,, plotted against the peak
stress u/E,, for a range of densities p/p,. Norma&d
in this way, the diagram describes all elastic foams,
If the critical damage stress is selected, then the
diagram gives the foam density which will absorb the
greatest amount of energy without this stress being
exceeded. The lower the peak stress, the lower is the
optimum foam density. As an example, using Fig. 19

deformation-mode map, which shows how each of
the three parts changes as the relative density
changes. The method can be applied to man-made
foams (Figs 13-16) and to natural materials, such as
woods (Figs 17 and 18), to give diagrams which
summarise the stress-strain response of each class of
material.
The mechanical properties of cellular solids can be
modelled with precision. The models lead to consti-
tutive laws (stress-strain relations) which have been
thoroughly tested in simple compression. They are
summa&d in Table 4. The constitutive laws can be
used to construct deformation-mode maps, and can
be integrated to construct energy-absorption
dia-
grams. These diagrams (Figs 19-22) show how the
energy absorbed, per unit volume of foam, depends
on the density of the foam and on the stress. The
The equations derived in the text, and summarised
in Table 4, provide the basic information for design
with foams in load-bearing applications. The tests
described above ail involved simple compression.
Under multiaxial loads, the behaviour is more com-
plicated. At small strains (s < 5x), while the material
is linear-elastic, it behaves like any other elastic solid
[I, 31with Young’s modulus E* given by equation (6)
and Poisson’s ratio v = f. But once the plateau-stress
has been reached, the behaviour changes: the exten-
sive deformation at nearly constant stress involves a
large volume change, but almost no lateral strain
[l, 3,26,271 so that v x 0. The the material fails
under a multiaxial state of stress when the maximum
principal stress (not the octahedral shear stress)
reaches the critical value of u* [equation (8) for
flexible foams, equation (10) for plastic foams]. Be-
cause of this, the indentation hardness of plastic
foams is equal to 0,: (not 36; as in dense solids) and
the force needed to compress a foam is the same
whether it is free at its edges or constrained there [15].
Once densification starts, of course, the properties
revert towards those of conventional solids.
The deformation mode map for a class of foams
provides a compact summary of the mechanical
response of the class. In particular, the maps give a
rational way of selecting the material and density
which will give a desired stress-strain response.
Similarly, the energy-absorption diagram for a class
of foam summarises the energy absorbing capacity of
all members of the class. The diagrams identify the
optimum foam material and density for a given
packaging, padding or cushioning application.
