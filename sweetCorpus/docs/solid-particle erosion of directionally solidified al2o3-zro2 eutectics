Resistance to solid-particle erosion was studied by measuring individual damage sites in directionally
solidified Al2 O3 –ZrO2 (Y2 O3 ) eutectics that contained three concentrations of Y2 O3 (0.5, 3, and 9% in
the ZrO2 phase). For comparison, polycrystalline Al2 O3 , sapphire, and polycrystalline and single-crystal
tetragonally stabilized ZrO2 were also studied. All specimens were impacted at normal incidence by
angular 63 and 143 ␮m SiC particles traveling at 100 m/s. The eutectics containing 3% and 9 mol.% Y2 O3
generally exhibited the smallest damage zones and the ZrO2 specimens exhibited by far the largest
damage zones. Examination of damage features and comparison with basic mechanical properties and
models for erosion of brittle materials led to conclusions that the eutectics were resistant to erosion
because of the presence of large compressive residual stresses in their Al2 O3 phases and that the ZrO2
materials were susceptible to erosive damage because transformation toughening was ineffective in
reducing propagation of lateral cracks that emanated from the damage sites.

1. Introduction
Directionally solidified eutectic ceramics (DSECs) exhibit a wide
range of useful properties. They are being considered for use in
applications such as advanced gas turbines, substrates for thin
films, and bioengineered systems [1–3]. Much is known about
processing and microstructural development of eutectic ceram-
ics [1–17]. Well-made oxide eutectics exhibit excellent mechanical
properties to near their melting points [10,15], and many thorough
studies of their mechanical properties have been published ([1] and
references therein).
We are especially interested in the fundamentals of direction-
ally solidified Al2 O3 –ZrO2 (Y2 O3 ) eutectics because of the wide
range of microstructures and the many mechanical properties that
have been reported. Elastic modulus, hardness, fracture strength,
fracture toughness, creep, resistance to sliding wear, and residual
stresses have all been studied in materials for which microstruc-

ture has been characterized well [1,14,17–26]. Given the excellent
resistances of these eutectics to sliding wear [23], one might also
expect good resistance to wear by solid-particle erosion.
We have studied solid-particle erosion of ceramics, compos-
ites, and brittle materials for many years [27–35]. We report here
on measurements of the resistances of three directionally solidi-
fied Al2 O3 –ZrO2 (Y2 O3 ) eutectics to erosion by sharp SiC abrasives.
These studies were conducted to determine the basic mecha-
nisms of material removal and whether the eutectics are resistant
to erosion. For comparison, sapphire, polycrystalline Al2 O3 , and
single-crystal and polycrystalline Y2 O3 -stabilized ZrO2 specimens
were also tested.
2. Background
Solid-particle erosion is usually measured as mass or volume
of target lost per mass or volume of erodent particles impacting
the surface [27–38]. Consistent results and good fits to models
of erosion of brittle materials have been obtained when the ero-
dent particles are significantly harder than the targets they impact
[39–41]. The precision of a determination for erosion rate is depen-
dent on variables such as the area of the surface being eroded,
the mass of erodent used, and the number of materials-loss tests
conducted.
Because only comparatively small rods of directionally solidified
Al2 O3 –ZrO2 (Y2 O3 ) eutectics could be obtained, we decided to study
erosion by examination of individual impact sites. Careful measure-
ments of the sizes of damage zones, coupled with direct observation

by scanning electron microscopy, can yield many useful insights.
This approach has been used, for example, to study impact damage
in soda-lime glass and polycrystalline alumina [42,43].
Impact of brittle materials by solid particles has been shown to
lead to formation of radial and lateral cracks that emanate from an
elastic-plastic impact site [36–38,42,44–48]. The models contend
[36–38,44–48] and experiments have confirmed [27,29,32–36,42]
that for impact by hard particles, lateral cracks are indeed respon-
sible for material loss in many brittle materials. For normal impact
pressure P, the lateral cracks that form have length cL , where
cL = A
F(E/H)3/4
1/2
P 5/8 ,
Kc H 1/4
(1)
and A is a constant, F is a geometric factor, E is the target elastic mod-
ulus, H is the target hardness, and Kc is the critical stress-intensity
factor of the target [47].
For normal impact pressure P, the radial cracks that form have
length cR , where
cR =
2/3
F ∗ (E/H)1/2
P 2/3 ,
Kc H 1/4
(2)
and F* is a geometric factor and the other terms are as defined in
Eq. (1) [46]. Radial crack lengths are generally significant relative
to those of lateral cracks, but they do not contribute significantly
to materials-loss by erosion because they do not enclose a volume
of material.
This model will form the basis of our analysis of single-impact
damage sites in our specimens. It can be extended to predict mate-
rial loss by impact from a great many non-interacting particles of
approximately uniform size. Other researchers have also developed
models for impact by sharp particles arriving at normal incidence.
They agree broadly, but not in the fine details. Evans et al. devel-
oped a dynamic impact model [36], in which erosion rate W defined
as eroded volume per volume of erodent striking the target can be
expressed as
W ∝ V 3.2 R3.7
0.25
−1.3 −0.25
Kc
H
,
(3)
where V is the velocity of the impacting particle, R is the particle
radius, is the particle density, and Kc and H of the target are as
defined in Eq. (1).
The quasi-static model of Wiederhorn and coworkers for erosion
of brittle solids predicts
W ∝ V 2.4 R3.7
1.2
−1.3 0.11
Kc
H
,
(4)
where all terms are as defined previously [44,45].
Ritter et al. model the problem by defining the volume X of
material removed per impact event:
−1
X = E 1.25 Kc H −1.4 U 1.2 ,
(5)
where is a constant, E is the target elastic modulus, U is the kinetic
energy of the impacting particle, and Kc and H are as in the previous
equations [48].
These models indicate that tough, hard targets are most resis-
tant to erosion, with toughness being the more-dominant materials
property in determining steady-state erosion rate. Eqs. (1)–(5) pro-
vide a quantitative basis for comparing impact damage to the
properties of the target material.
3. Experimental details
3.1. Materials
Three sets of directionally solidified Al2 O3 –ZrO2 (Y2 O3 ) eutec-
tic rods were studied; they contained 0.5, 3, or 9 mol.% Y2 O3

in the ZrO2 phase. These rods will be designated 0.5Y, 3Y, and
9Y. The ZrO2 phase was primarily monoclinic in the 0.5Y rod,
tetragonal in the 3Y rod, and cubic in the 9Y rod [49]. The rods
were grown at a solidification rate of 10 mm/h. Details of their
processing and resulting microstructures can be found in Refs.
[14,18,49]. The microstructures consisted of a homogeneous dis-
persion of elongated zirconia particles (degenerated lamellae with
a width-to-length ratio of approximately 0.35), with interlamellar
spacing of approximately 2 ␮m embedded in a continuous sapphire
matrix.
The diameters of the Al2 O3 –ZrO2 (Y2 O3 ) rods were all
2.2–2.3 mm. The crystallography of these samples is described in
Ref. [14] and can be defined by interpenetrating bicrystals, for
which alumina grew preferentially with the c-axis parallel to the
growth direction and the various zirconia phases on average grew
perpendicular to the {0 0 1} or {0 1 1} planes.
For comparison, the erosion characteristics of various Al2 O3 and
ZrO2 specimens were also studied. Sapphire and polycrystalline
specimens and single-crystal and polycrystalline ZrO2 /3 mol% Y2 O3
(3-TZY) specimens were obtained from our archives. The Al2 O3
was a silica-bonded specimen with a microstructure that featured
a bimodal grain-size distribution of angular grains approximately
7 and 45 ␮m in average diameter. The polycrystalline 3-TZY spec-
imen consisted of fine, equiaxed grains approximately 0.7 ␮m in
diameter (Fig. 1).
A summary of the expected mechanical properties for the vari-
ous targets is shown in Table 1. Vickers hardness (Hv) values were
measured with a Buehler MicroMet 5103 Tester (Lake Bluff, IL). For
all measurements, the load was 1 kg and the time of indentation
was 10 s. Elastic modulus (E) and fracture toughness (KIC ) values
were taken from the literature.

3.2. Experiments
Surfaces of all specimens were polished with 1 ␮m diamond grit
so that Vickers microhardness or impact damage could be stud-
ied. The erosion experiments were conducted in a slinger-type
apparatus that has been described [59]. The pressure of the test
chamber was reduced to 40 Pa, and thus aerodynamic effects were
minimized. Particle feed rates were sufficiently low to minimize
particle–particle interactions and total feeds were small enough to
minimize overlapping of impact sites. The erodent particles were
angular SiC abrasives (Crystalon 37, Norton Co., Worcester, MA,
USA) of nominal diameter 63 or 143 ␮m. This erodent was selected
because it has been used in many of our other studies of brittle

materials [32] and because it is harder than any of the target ceram-
ics [39–41,60]. For erosion of brittle materials, a sufficiently hard
erodent will produce indentation types of damage. As an erodent
approaches the hardness of its target, the indentation mechanism
will not operate [60]. The choice of SiC as the erodent thus has
advantages of producing a type of damage for which models are
available and for which data can be compared with those of many
other studies. It has the disadvantage of limiting application of the
data and analyses to real-world erosion problems, for which softer
erodents, such as silica, are often encountered.
The impact velocity was 100 m/s and the impact angle was 90◦ . A
velocity of 100 m/s was chosen not for any specific application, but
rather because it has been used in many previous erosion studies
and thus direct comparisons with other data sets can be made.
The eroded surfaces were examined by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) in a Hitachi S-4700-II (Tokyo, Japan) field-
emission microscope. Surfaces were coated with a thin layer of
carbon prior to being examined. Damage sites were also examined
with a MicroXAM interferometric surface profiler (ADE Phase Shift,
Tucson, AZ). The dimensions of the damage sites were taken as
the maximum areal extent of plastic indentation and extension of
cracks, and the maximum depth h of the indentation (Fig. 2). Radial
cracks (R) emanating beneath the impact zone were not measured,
nor need they be because these cracks do not contribute to material
removal [36–38,44–48].
4. Results
The first set of measurements focused on SEM of individual
impact sites and the second set on their depths determined by pro-
filometry. The range of response to erosive impact was surprisingly
wide. The data are compiled in Table 2. The error bars reflect stan-
dard deviations. Individual measurements were estimated to be
accurate to within a few percent. Given the large standard devia-
tions, this additional source of uncertainty is negligible. Only SEM
of the specimens impacted by 143 ␮m SiC is shown. This choice was
made simply because the larger sites were easier to image well.

The polycrystalline Al2 O3 specimen exhibited a pattern that has
been seen by others [29,61,62]. Plastic indentation and material
removal by formation of a combination of what appeared to be
wholesale removal of grains and propagation of lateral cracks were
observed (Fig. 3a). There was significant scatter in the sizes of the
damage zones. The damage zones were deep, often flat-bottomed,
and their depths exhibited comparatively little scatter (Table 2;
Fig. 3b). The damage zones in the sapphire specimens were quali-
tatively similar, but the damage areas were generally smaller and
the depths more shallow (Table 2; Fig. 3c and d).
The damage zones in the polycrystalline 3-TZY specimen were
larger than in the Al2 O3 or sapphire specimens. In particular, the lat-
eral cracks extended further and produced more material removal.
Lateral cracking was especially pronounced in the single-crystal
3-TZY specimen (Fig. 4).
The DSECs exhibited similar microstructures, but those of the
3Y and 9Y specimens were more uniform. Impact damage in the
0.5Y DSEC could be measured only partially. SEM images and sur-
face profilometry were obtained for transverse cross sections, for
which damage zones were characterized by indentation, along with
limited cracking (Fig. 5a–c). Longitudinal section exhibited many
very long cracks that appeared to extend from impact damage sites
(Fig. 5d). These cracks were so long that they could not be measured
reliably.
The damage zones in the 3Y and 9Y DSECs were essentially iden-
tical (Figs. 6 and 7). Indentation sites all exhibited debris and clear
evidence of indentation, but only limited cracking.
5. Discussion
Examination of Eqs. (1)–(5) indicates damage zone size
should decrease with increasing toughness. Scattergood and

coworkers have measured erosion rates for many ceramics
([27,30,39,42,61,63–65] and references therein). They modeled
effects of materials properties of both the erodent particles and
the target on erosion rate. They concluded that for a given ero-
dent particle, erosion rate was determined primarily by the fracture
toughness of the target [66], with the toughest targets being as
expected most resistant to erosive damage.
The data taken here do not obviously follow a trend of higher
fracture toughness resulting in greater resistance to erosion. More
information is needed. Considerations of individual damage pat-
terns, often by comparing directly two different ceramic materials,
can allow one to extract useful insights into the erosion resistances
of the ceramics measured here.
For the three types of Al2 O3 specimens, the best resistance to
erosive damage was exhibited by the basal plane sapphire. Sap-
phire and Al2 O3 have previously been shown to be comparatively
resistant to solid-particle erosion [67,68], with short-crack-length
fracture toughness dominating its erosion resistance. Sapphire’s
hardness is highest in the basal plane [69] and, as shown in Table 1,
this plane’s fracture resistance is superior to that of coarse-grained
Al2 O3 or non-basal plane sapphire [69–74]. For these specimens, as
expected, damage zone size scaled with basic mechanical proper-
ties.
The damage zones for the polycrystalline Al2 O3 were unexpect-
edly deep, and they were approximately independent of erodent
size. Examination by SEM and surface profilometry suggested that
the damage depth was often determined by removal of a grain of
material rather than by plastic indentation. Silica-bonded Al2 O3 has
comparatively weak grain boundaries and such a mechanism for
material loss—grain-boundary fracture and removal of grain—has
been observed previously [27]. This mechanism would explain both
the measured depths and independence of depth on size of erodent
particle.
The polycrystalline 3-TZY specimens possessed by far the lowest
elastic modulus values and the highest fracture toughness val-
ues. One would expect them to be the most resistant to erosive
damage. Instead, they were the least resistant. Comparatively poor
resistance to solid-particle erosion has been observed before for
tetragonally stabilized zirconias [65,66]. The explanation we offer
for this fact emerges from the details of its toughening mechanism.
Stress fields at cracks result in transformation of tetragonal
to monoclinic zirconia. The resulting volumetric expansion places
closing tractions along the crack, reducing the driving force for
propagation and increasing fracture toughness. Fig. 8 , adapted from
Marshall et al. [47], shows an ideal impact damage zone. Below an
indentation is found a plastically deformed zone (PZ), from which
extend radials cracks (R) and lateral cracks (L). A residual force Pr
driven by the radially expanding plastic zone determines the crack-
driving force. Examination of this model damage zone indicates
the effects of transformation toughening should be different for
propagation of radial cracks than for propagation of lateral cracks.
Transformation toughening should be quite effective in limiting the

extension of radial cracks. Volumetric expansion along the crack
should indeed exert crack-closing tractions. The results obtained in
this study meet this expectation: no evidence of significant exten-
sion of lateral cracks was observed.
For extension of lateral cracks, the region designated at V in
Fig. 8 must be considered. The dimensions of this volume may
be quite wide, but the depth is shallow. In our specimens, the
depths were typically 2–3 ␮m. For a volume expansion caused by
phase transformation, there is no overlying volume of material to
constrain the expansion toward the surface direction. For a poly-
crystalline specimen, transformation would result in volumetric
expansions along the three axes of the individual lattice directions
of crystals that would be randomly oriented. Some crack deflec-
tion or microcracking could occur to dissipate some of the fracture
energy. For the single-crystal, resistance to propagation of lateral
cracks should be much worse. Rather than creating a closing trac-
tion along the crack wake, the volumetric expansion caused by
transformation to the monoclinic phase should act as a wedge,
driving a lateral crack further. These cracks should propagate quite
freely in the zirconia specimens, especially in the single-crystal
specimen, as they do indeed appear to do.
This qualitative description of why 3-TZY specimens are highly
susceptible to erosive damage in the form of propagation of lateral
cracks can be tested. Breder et al. have done so quite elegantly [75].
They prepared a series of Al2 O3 specimens that contained 10% zir-
conia. Three different treatments were applied, resulting in three
different fractions of tetragonal zirconia near the surface. They then
measured erosion rates and fracture strengths after erosion test-
ing. Erosion rates are determined by propagation of lateral cracks.
Reduction in strength is determined by extent of radial cracking.
They found erosion rate to be independent of fraction of tetragonal
zirconia, but strength to be proportional to fraction of tetragonal
zirconia. Transformation toughening reduced radial crack propa-
gation, but not lateral crack propagation.

The 3Y and 9Y DSEC specimens were highly resistant to erosive
damage, but the 0.5Y DSEC was not. In fact, very little propagation
of lateral cracks could be observed for the 3Y and 9Y specimens.
Each of the three specimens possessed a lamellar microstructure.
Ceramics such as thermal barrier coatings and fiber composites also
exhibit lamellar microstructures. Solid-particle erosion studies of
such materials have revealed effects of such microstructures on
erosion rate [76–80], but they do not provide an explanation of why
the 3Y and 9Y specimens would be so resistant to erosive damage.
The starkest differences between 0.5Y and 3Y/9Y direction-
ally solidified Al2 O3 –ZrO2 (Y2 O3 ) eutectics were their room-
temperature residual stress states. The residual stresses in the
Al2 O3 phase were, in both the transverse and longitudinal direc-
tions, highly tensile for the 0.5Y specimen, but highly compressive
for the 3Y and 9Y specimens (see Fig. 5.3 in Ref. [1]). In fact the
longitudinal residual stress for the 0.5Y specimen has been shown
to exceed 1 GPa [1]. The extreme crack propagation in the longi-
tudinal direction that was observed in these studies is no doubt
due primarily to the residual stress states. In contrast, compressive
stress of approximately 400 MPa in both directions for the 3Y and 9Y
specimens should be quite effective in resisting crack propagation
[81,82].
A more-subtle difference among the DSECs was observed in
comparing the results for impact by 63 and 143 ␮m SiC particles.
The 3Y and 9Y specimens were the most resistant to damage when
impacted by the smaller particles, but were approximately equal in
resistance to basal plane sapphire when impacted by the larger par-
ticles. The trends appeared to be significant statistically (Table 2).
We offer no firm explanation, but two possible reasons can be
offered. It is possible that with larger crack-driving force, the effects
of residual stresses were partially overcome. It is also possible that
the larger kinetic energy of 143 ␮m particles induced more local
heating, which could have relaxed the residual stresses. Significant
local heating leading to discernible melting has been reported for
low-ductility target materials [83,84]. We saw no evidence of such
heating in any of the specimens, but effects of heating cannot be
ruled out.
Three sets of experiments to test the explanations offered here
can be envisioned. Two should be comparatively easy, one more
difficult.
(1) If DSECs are resistant to erosive damage because of resid-
ual stresses rather than some other property related to their
complex microstructures [24], then similar DSECs that do
not contain significant residual stresses can be tested. We
have obtained data for steady-state erosion of a series of
Al2 O3 –yttrium aluminum garnet DSECs [85]. These DSECs were
in fact no more erosion resistant than were their constituent
ceramics.
(2) Steady-state erosion data should be obtained for direction-
ally solidified Al2 O3 –ZrO2 (Y2 O3 ) eutectics. It may well be that
repeated impact will reduce the resistance to erosion, through
some combination of heating and interaction of many cracks.
(3) Erosion of directionally solidified Al2 O3 –ZrO2 (Y2 O3 ) eutectics
could be measured as a function of temperature [81]. Many of
the mechanical properties of Al2 O3 , sapphire, and direction-
ally solidified Al2 O3 –ZrO2 (Y2 O3 ) eutectics are comparatively
insensitive to temperature, to at least 1000 ◦ C [1,72–74]. Resid-
ual stresses do, however, relax. We do not have the capability
to measure erosion as a function of temperature, but others do.
This work revealed clear trends in erosive damage and plausible
explanations can be offered for each of them. Proof awaits gathering
additional data.

6. Conclusions
Resistance to damage from sharp SiC particles impacting a tar-
get at 100 m/s was studied for directionally solidified Al2 O3 –ZrO2
(Y2 O3 ) eutectics that contained three concentrations of Y2 O3 (0.5,
3, and 9% in the ZrO2 phase) and for these related target ceramics:
polycrystalline Al2 O3 , sapphire, and polycrystalline and single-
crystal tetragonally stabilized ZrO2 . Damage zones consisted of
combinations of plastic indentation and cracking. Their sizes were
measured by SEM and surface profilometry. The Al2 O3 and sap-
phire specimens were much more resistant to damage than were
the ZrO2 specimens. The ZrO2 exhibited by far the largest damage
zones because of significant extension of lateral cracks. The eutec-
tics containing 3 and 9% Y generally exhibited minimal cracking
and generally the smallest damage zones. Comparison with basic
mechanical properties and models for erosion of brittle materials
suggested that the ZrO2 materials were susceptible to erosive dam-
age because transformation toughening was ineffective in reducing
propagation of lateral cracks that emanated from the damage sites.
Erosion and fracture studies by Breder et al. [75] support this con-
clusion. The eutectics that contained 3 and 9% Y were concluded to
be resistant to erosion because of the presence of large compressive
residual stresses in their Al2 O3 phases. This explanation is plausi-
ble, but remains unproven. Experiments to test its validity and the
inherent resistances to erosion of the eutectics were suggested.
