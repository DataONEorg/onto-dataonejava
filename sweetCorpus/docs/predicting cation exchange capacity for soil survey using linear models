Predicting Cation Exchange Capacity for Soil Survey Using Linear Models
C. A. Seybold,* R. B. Grossman, and T. G. Reinsch
ABSTRACT
sons, clay and organic matter differences between soils
should be incorporated into any kind of predictive model.
Several researchers have attempted to predict CEC
from clay and organic C contents alone, using multiple
regression. Results show that greater than 50% of the
variation in CEC could be explained by the variation in
clay and organic C content for several New Jersey soils
(Drake and Motto, 1982), for sandy soils in Florida (Yuan
et al., 1967), for some Philippine soils (Sahrawat, 1983),
and for four soils in Mexico (Bell and van Keulen, 1995).
Only a small improvement was obtained by adding pH
to the model for four Mexican soils (Bell and van Keu-
len, 1995). In B horizons of a toposequence, the amount
of fine clay (Ͻ0.2 ␮m) was shown to explain a larger
percent of the variation in CEC than the total clay
content (Wilding and Rutledge, 1966). In gleyed subsoil
horizons of lowland soils in Quebec, surface area (of the
soil) gave a better prediction of CEC than did total clay
(Martel et al., 1978). Martel et al. (1978) also showed that
the variations in mineralogical composition, although
small, were sufficient to explain nearly 50% of the vari-
ation in CEC. Similarly, Miller (1970) found that the
type of clay alone could explain up to 50% of the varia-
tion in CEC. Many of the above predictive models are
specific to a region or area and confined to only a few
soil types. Our approach is to develop predictive models
that provide a comprehensive coverage of soils of the
United States.
When using least squares estimates in CEC models,
the assumption is made that the compositions of the
clay and organic matter are identical from one sample
to another and that the soils vary only in the amounts
of the components present (Stevenson, 1994). For this
reason, regression equations tend to be accurate only
within a limited geographic and climatic zone, where
the composition of the clay and organic fractions are
reasonably homogenous (Helling et al., 1964). When soils
of diverse genesis are included in the analyses and little
or no attempt is made to control for variables such as
mineralogical composition, soil properties become less
predictive (Syers et al., 1970). When soils are grouped
by similarities in origin or properties, accuracy of pre-
dictive models (in general) has been shown to improve
(Pachepsky and Rawls, 1999). Drake and Motto (1982)
grouped soils by taxonomic order or province, which
proved superior in defining groups for predicting CEC.
Similarly, Asadu and Akamigbo (1990) predicted CEC
from organic matter and clay content grouped by taxo-
nomic order (Inceptisols, Alfisols, Ultisols, and Oxisols).
They indicated that partitioning the data by taxonomic
order resulted in regression equations that were signifi-
cantly distinct from each other, as the groupings tended
to reduce the variability in soil properties. The U.S. Soil
Measuring the cation exchange capacity (CEC) for all horizons of
every map unit component in a survey area is very time consuming
and costly. The objective of this study was to develop CEC (pH 7
NH4OAc) prediction models that encompass most soils of the United
States. The National Soil Survey Characterization database was used
to develop the predictive models using general linear models. Data
were stratified into more homogeneous groups based on the organic
C content, soil pH, taxonomic family mineralogy class and CEC-
activity class, and taxonomic order. Models were developed for each
strata or data group. Organic matter and noncarbonate clay contents
were the main predictor variables used. Water at Ϫ1500 kPa was used
in lieu of clay content on four groups. Results indicate that between
43 and 78% of the variation in CEC could be explained for the high
organic C data groups; between 53 and 84% could be explained for
the mineralogy groups; between 86 and 95% could be explained for
the CEC-activity class groups; and between 53 and 86% could be
explained for the taxonomic orders. The same predictive model was
applicable for Gelisols and Histosols. Inceptisols and Alfisols (Ͼ0.3%
organic C) also shared the same model. In general, the mineralogy/
CEC-activity class equations had lower RMSEs than the taxonomic
order equations. A decision tree, based on how the data was stratified,
guides the selection of which model to use for a soil layer. Validation
results indicated that the models, in aggregate, provide a reasonable
estimate of CEC for most soils of the United States.
C
ation exchange capacity is the total of the ex-
changeable cations that a soil can hold at a speci-
fied pH. Soil components known to contribute to CEC
are clay and organic matter, and to a lesser extent, silt
(Martel et al., 1978; Manrique et al., 1991). The exchange
sites can be either permanent or pH-dependent. Mineral
soils have an exchange capacity that is a combination
of permanent and pH-dependent charge sites, while that
of organic soils is predominantly pH-dependent. In any
given soil, the number of exchange sites is dependent on
the soil pH; type, size, and amount of clay; and amount,
decomposition state, and source of the organic material
(Kamprath and Welch, 1962; Parfitt et al., 1995; Syers
et al., 1970; Miller, 1970). The relationship between clay
content (% by weight) and CEC can be highly variable
because different clay minerals have very different CECs,
and the relative proportion of pH-dependant and per-
manent CEC varies among clay minerals (Miller, 1970).
Cation exchange capacity of organic soils increases mark-
edly with increases in pH, and increases with greater
degrees of humification (Stevenson, 1994). For these rea-

SEYBOLD ET AL.: PREDICTING CATION EXCHANGE CAPACITY FOR SOIL SURVEY
Taxonomy system (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) also classi-
fies soil by mineralogical composition at the family level,
which may be useful in partitioning soils to improve both
accuracy and reliability of predictive models (Pachepsky
and Rawls, 1999).
The National Soil Information System (NASIS) is a
relational database of the USDA-NRCS that is used to
manage soil survey data. Map unit attributes are stored
and maintained in NASIS. Properties in NASIS are es-
timated, either from direct observation in the field, use
of predictive models, or laboratory measurement. Cat-
ion exchange capacity values (based on the buffered am-
monium acetate method at pH 7) should be populated
for most horizons of map unit components with a pH
of Ն5.5 (Soil Survey Staff, 2002). For soil layers with a
pH of Ͻ5.5, the effective cation exchange capacity is pop-
ulated. In many cases, CEC values (in addition to other
properties) are unavailable in the database because of
increases in data requirements over time. Also, it is too
time-consuming and costly to measure CEC everywhere
in a survey. Soil scientists mapping and making entries
into NASIS need a reliable method for estimating CEC.
The estimation procedure should be comprehensive (en-
compass most soils of the United States) and be able to
predict CEC from accessory or readily available soil
properties.
The objectives of this project were to develop CEC pre-
diction models that function comprehensively for the
range of U.S. soils. The goal is to use basic soil survey
data as input. To improve predictability, the data will be
stratified, such as by soil taxonomic order or mineralogy/
CEC-activity class. These prediction models will benefit
NRCS field soil scientists making entries into NASIS.
More importantly, these models should improve the ac-
curacy of estimated CEC data and aid in populating the
database, which will benefit all users of soil survey data
and their interpretations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data (pre-1999) from the National Soil Survey characteriza-
tion database in Lincoln, Nebraska, were used to develop the
predictive CEC models. The characterization database con-
tains more than 135 000 horizons with measured CEC data,
representing soils from across the continental United States,
Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and several foreign countries. Rele-
vant data in the database include taxonomic classifications,
morphological descriptions, horizon designations, and analyti-
cal data such as organic carbon, exchange characteristics, parti-
cle-size separates, pH, and water retention characteristics.
Stratification of Data
The database was partitioned into more homogeneous soil
groups to improve the accuracy of CEC estimates. The first
division of the data was based on organic C content. An initial
query of the database selected records where the pH (in water)
was Ն5.5 and organic C content was Յ8%. The break at 8%
organic C is a method break. Organic C by the Walkley–Black
method is generally reliable only up to 8% (Soil Survey Staff,
1995). The Ͻ8% organic C data group was further subdivided
by taxonomic family mineralogy and CEC-activity class. There
are 21 taxonomic family mineralogy classes excluding mixed and
siliceous (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). Soils with mixed and sili-
857
ceous mineralogy were grouped by CEC-activity class, where
applicable. In Soil Taxonomy, a CEC-activity class is generally
assigned to soils with a mixed or siliceous mineralogy at the
family level (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). However, there are ex-
ceptions to assigning CEC-activity classes. They are not as-
signed to Histosols or Histels, or to Oxisols, and Alfisols and
Ultisols with “kandi” or “kanhap” great groups or subgroups
because they would be redundant; all of these would be in a
subactive class by definition (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). In addi-
tion, CEC-activity classes are also not assigned to soils with
sandy, sandy-skeletal, or fragmental particle-size classes. Within
the characterization database many pedons did not have taxo-
nomic classifications assigned; therefore, for some mineralogy
classes there were little or no data available. Only 12 out of
the 21 soil mineralogy classes had enough data from which to
develop a model. To ensure that models are developed that
cover all soils, the Ͻ8% organic C data group was also parti-
tioned by taxonomic order. In a second query, records were
selected where the pH (in water) was Ն5.5 and organic C
content was Յ8%, and then subdivided by taxonomic order.
There are 12 soil orders in Soil Taxonomy. In total, data were
stratified into 12 mineralogy classes and four CEC-activity
classes, or 12 soil order groups. The Mollisol and Alfisol orders
were the most common and have the largest datasets. Separat-
ing out the higher organic matter layers of the Mollisol and
Alfisol orders increased the R2 and lowered the RMSEs of
the resulting equations. The organic C break at 0.3% was the
point at which the organic C content became an insignificant
predictor variable in these two soil orders. The two stratifica-
tion groupings of the data (by mineralogy/CEC-activity class
or soil order) were compared to determine which grouping
would explain the most variation in the CEC data, and thus
indicate the most homogeneous groups from which models
could later be developed. A third grouping was added in the
comparison: grouping by horizon designation (e.g., A, Bt, C),
which has been used in other studies to stratify the data (Wild-
ing and Rutledge, 1966; Asadu and Akamigbo, 1990). In addi-
tion, model RMSEs were compared between the mineralogy/
CEC-activity and soil order equations to aid in determining
which grouping provides the most accurate estimations. Only
the RMSEs on the log transformed scale were compared.
Soil layers with high organic C contents (Ͼ8%) were further
partitioned into six data groups. Thus, a third query of the
database selected records where the pH (in water) was Ն5.5
and total C was Ͼ8%. A plot of the CEC versus pH showed
a bimodal distribution with a pH break at 7.0. Therefore, this
high organic C data group was subdivided into two groups
based on a pH break at 7.0. Then, the Ͻ7.0 pH data group was
further subdivided into four groups based on the degree of
organic matter decomposition (fibric, hemic, and sapric) and
an organic C content break at 14.5%. Decomposition state
(fibric, hemic, and sapric) of soils with organic C contents Ն
14.5% was indicated by O horizon designation (Oi, Oe, and
Oa, respectively). The fourth group consists of an undivided
group with an organic C content of Ͻ14.5%. The Ͼ7.0 pH
data group was subdivided into two groups by an organic C
content of 14.5%. The break at 14.5% organic C separates
mineral from organic soil material. Soil Survey Staff (1999)
defines organic materials as having 12 to 20% organic C de-
pending on the clay content and duration of saturation. An
organic C content of 14.5% (approximately 25% organic mat-
ter) was chosen as the break between organic and mineral
materials for this project. Also, in NASIS, particle size sepa-
rates (sand, silt, and clay) are generally not populated when
organic matter contents are above 25%. For the soil groups
with Ͻ14.5% organic C, particle-size separates (e.g., clay con-
tent) can be used as predictive variables.

Soil Properties
Variables used in predicting CEC were pH in water, pH
in 0.01 M CaCl2, total clay and total silt (pipette method),
noncarbonate clay, organic C (acid-dichromate digestion), to-
tal C (dry combustion), and Ϫ1500-kPa water (pressure-mem-
brane extraction using sieved samples). Cation exchange ca-
pacity was determined by NH4OAc at pH 7. All methods are
described by the Soil Survey Staff (1996). All determinations
were on air-dried (30–35ЊC), crushed, and sieved (Ͻ2 mm)
soil samples. Data are reported on oven-dry basis. Carbonate
clay has negligible CEC (Shields and Meyer, 1964). Therefore,
percent carbonate clay was subtracted from the percent total
clay to get noncarbonate clay. This procedure makes it possible
to obtain the noncarbonate clay percentage and removes the
disadvantage of the particle-size measurement. A Ϫ1500-kPa
water to clay ratio of Ͼ0.6 has been used to indicate poor
dispersion in particle size determinations (Soil Survey Staff,
1995, 1999). Poorly crystalline materials and high organic C
contents also tend to increase this ratio. When clay or noncar-
bonate clay was used as a predictor variable, ratios of Ͼ0.6
(Ϫ1500-kPa water to clay ratio) were excluded from the data.
Also, the Ϫ1500-kPa water to clay ratio of Ͼ0.6 exclusion was
not used for any of the high organic C data groups.
Model Validation
An independent dataset was used to validate the models
in aggregate. One-hundred and fifty pedons were randomly
selected from the National Soil Survey characterization data-
base, from years 2000 to 2002. The soils represent pedons
from all across the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii.
Each horizon of each pedon was run through the appropriate
predictive model to estimate CEC (using the decision tree).
If the horizon pH (in water) was Ͻ5.5, no CEC was estimated.
As a result, 793 horizons of estimated CEC values were used
in the validation process.
Statistics
For each data group, CEC was estimated using general
linear model procedures in SYSTAT Software (2002). Only
data elements that contributed significantly (P ϭ 0.05) to pre-
dicting CEC were used in the regression equations. Also, only
variables that contributed Ͼ5% to the overall improvement
of the R2 value were included in the equations. Scatter plots
of the residuals versus the fitted values of each model were
used to indicate whether there was nonlinearity, unequal vari-
ances, and outliers in the data. When a classic horn-shaped
pattern was evident in the plot, natural log transformations
of the data were performed. The horn-shaped pattern indicates
a combination of a poor fit to the subpopulation averages and
increasing variability (Ramsey and Schafer, 1997). All outliers,
as identified by the studentized residual in SYSTAT Software
(2002), were removed from the data groups. Pearson correla-
tions were performed to determine variable colinearity and
help in the selection of predictive variables. For some data
groups (that had low correlation coefficients between variables,
e.g., Vertisols), a forward stepwise regression procedure in
SYSTAT Software (2002) was used to help identify additional
predictive variables from all possible. However, none identi-
fied proved to be useful predictive variables. Variables were
then added and subtracted from the general linear model until
the best model was found that contained statistically sig-
nificant, intuitively meaningful predictive variables, and vari-
ables that are readily obtainable within NASIS. A dummy-
variable regressor (taxonomic order or mineralogy) was used
to evaluate model redundancy between predictive equations
with the same variables (Fox, 1997). The post hoc Tukey test
(multiple mean comparison procedure) was used for compari-
son of equation intercepts (Zar, 1999). When intercepts be-
tween two equations were not significantly different, then the
slope coefficients were compared by checking the significance
of the interaction terms (dummy-variable and predictive vari-
able). When redundant equations were indicated (no signifi-
cant difference between slope coefficients and intercepts), the
data groups were combined and a new model was developed.
Model validation was evaluated by comparing measured ver-
sus predicted CEC values from an independent dataset. Confi-
dence intervals were calculated for the slope and intercept of
the least square estimate line. Statistically significant differ-
ences were determined using P ϭ 0.05.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Initial correlation analyses conducted within each
data group indicated that total silt, total clay or noncar-
bonate clay, organic C or total C, pH in water or CaCl2,
and Ϫ1500-kPa water were the variables most highly cor-
related with CEC (data not shown). Except for Ϫ1500-
kPa water, these variables are readily available soil
properties in NASIS; gravimetric Ϫ1500-kPa water can
be obtained indirectly within NASIS. The most highly
correlated variable with CEC varied, depending on the
data group. In general, Ϫ1500-kPa water was the single
most highly correlated variable with CEC among the
data groups. Total clay or noncarbonate clay and Ϫ1500-
kPa water were highly correlated with each other (r Ͼ
0.90) in most of the data groups. Therefore, they would
be redundant variables if both were included in a regres-
sion model. Clay content is a readily available soil prop-
erty, and is preferred over Ϫ1500-kPa water. However,
water content at Ϫ1500 kPa is preferred as a predictive
variable when poor clay dispersion in the particle size
determinations is a problem (and/or noncrystalline clays
dominate) for a data group. Field-based clay estimates
have been determined to be reliable (Nettleton et al.,
1999), which were not available for model development.
Poor clay dispersion is a problem in the amorphic,
glassy, and isotic mineralogy class data groups, and the
Spodosol and Andisol soil order data groups.
There are six high organic C data groups (OC Ͼ 8%)
for which prediction models were developed (Table 1).
For each equation the R2, the standard deviation about
the regression line (RMSE), and number of samples used
(n) are presented. For the high organic C data groups
with a pH of Յ 7.0, total C, pH in CaCl2, and noncarbon-
ate clay explained between 43 to 63% of the variation
in CEC (Table 1). A variable that may help improve the
predictability of CEC for these high organic C groups is
the fiber content (Lynn et al., 1974). Fiber content was
not explored as a potential predictive variable because
it is not a readily available data element in NASIS. For
the high organic C data groups with a pH of Ͼ7.0, total
C and noncarbonate clay explained between 78 and 87%
of the variability in CEC. Predictability of CEC was
greater for soil horizons with a pH of Ͼ7.0. Each of the
six predictive models is significantly unique. The six pre-
diction equations allow for the calculation of CEC for

soil layers with an organic C content of Ͼ8% and a soil
pH in water of Ն5.5.
Prediction models were developed for 12 of the family
mineralogy classes in Soil Taxonomy (Table 1). Organic
C, pH in water, noncarbonate clay, and Ϫ1500-kPa
water explained between 56 and 84% of the variability
in CEC of the 12 taxonomic family mineralogy class
data groups (Table 1). The CEC for the kaolinitic data
group was the most difficult to predict (R2 ϭ 0.55),
while the amorphic mineralogy class had the highest
predictability (R2 ϭ 0.84). Clay dispersion is indicated
to be a major problem in the amorphic, glassy, and isotic
mineralogy class groups, and thus, Ϫ1500-kPa water was
used as a predictive variable instead of percent clay. Silt
was a useful CEC predictor variable for the ferruginous,
magnesic, and kaolinitic mineralogy class groups. Soil pH
in water was a useful predictor variable for the amorphic,
parasesquic, micaceous, kaolinitic, illitic, vermiculitic, and
isotic mineralogy groups. The mineralogy and high or-
ganic C equations were determined to all be significantly
unique. Either the intercept or one of the slope coeffi-
cients was significantly different in equations with the
same variables. For the regression models presented in
this paper, it is assumed that the taxonomic mineralogy
class reflects that of the whole soil profile and not just
the mineralogy control section. There are cases where
this assumption fails such as in soils that have a litho-
logic discontinuity.
Four CEC-activity class predictive models were de-
veloped (Table 1). The CEC-activity classes are assigned
to soil with mixed and siliceous mineralogy. Organic C
and noncarbonate clay explained between 90 and 96%
of the variation in CEC within the CEC-activity class
groups (Table 1). The intercepts of the four CEC-activ-
ity class models are significantly different from each other,
making them unique equations. All the predictive equa-
tions for the soil groups in Table 1 were determined
to be significantly unique. Regression equations were
developed for all 12 soil orders (Table 2). Organic C,
noncarbonate clay, total silt, Ϫ1500-kPa water, and pH
in water explained between 55 and 86% of the variation
in CEC within the 12 soil orders (Table 2). The CEC
values for the Vertisol and Oxisol soil orders were the
most difficult to predict, with an R2 of 0.55 and 0.67,
respectively. Spodosols and Entisols had the greatest
predictability, with R2 values of 0.86 and 0.85, respec-
tively. Two models with different variables were devel-
oped for the Spodosol order; one using noncarbonate
clay and the other using Ϫ1500-kPa water content (Ta-
ble 2). The Ϫ1500-kPa water explained 86% of the vari-
ability in CEC alone for the Spodosol order, while or-
ganic C and noncarbonated clay explained only 71% of
the variability. In the Andisol order, Ϫ1500-kPa water
was also a useful variable because of clay dispersion
problems. For the Alfisol and Mollisol soil orders, the
R2 tended to improve when the low organic C horizons
(Ͻ0.3%) were separated from the high organic C hori-
zons. When organic C content was Ͻ0.3%, it became
an insignificant predictor variable. Tests for redundancy
among the CEC models containing the same predic-
tor variables indicated no significant difference in the
intercepts or the slope coefficients between the Alfisol
(OC Ͼ 0.3%) and Inceptisol equations, and between
the Gelisol and Histisol equations. These two pairs of
equations are considered redundant. The new models
of the combined data groups are shown in Table 2.
In comparison with the previous modeling efforts re-

and organic C accounted for up to 67% of the variation
in CEC for Alfisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Vertisols,
and up to 78% of the variation in CEC for Entisols and
Spodosols. The data used to develop these models are
from the same database as was used in the present study.
In the present study, data with clay dispersion prob-
lems were removed and data transformations were con-
ducted, which may explain the differences in the ability
to explain variation in CEC (for soil orders) in this study
and that of Manrique et al. (1991). Asadu and Akamigbo
(1990) also developed CEC prediction models for only
four of the soil orders by horizon. They found organic
matter and clay content to explain between 42% (in
Alfisols) to 80% (in Ultisols) of the variation in CEC
for all the A horizons and 23% (in Oxisols) to 67%
(in Inceptisols) for all the B horizons. For horizons of
Andisols that have andic properties, Nettleton et al.
(2001) found that 69% of the variation in CEC could
be explained by the organic C content alone.
The range in property values for each predictive vari-
able used in the development of each equation is pre-
sented in Table 3. Prediction of CEC for each individual
equation is valid only within the property range of the
predictive variables used to develop the model (Ramsey
and Schafer, 1997). Prediction of CEC and use of the
regression equations are limited to the range of proper-
ties used in this study, which encompasses most soils of
the United States.
Model Selection
In Tables 1 and 2, there are two sets of equations (taxo-
nomic order or mineralogy/CEC-activity equations)
that can be used to predict CEC for soil layers with less
than 8% organic C. When more than one prediction
equation is available for a particular soil, the most accu-
rate equation should be used (Pachepsky and Rawls,
1999). Three data grouping variables were compared—
by taxonomic family mineralogy/CEC-activity class, tax-
onomic order, and horizon designation. Taxonomic min-
eralogy/CEC-activity variable explained the most varia-
tion in CEC (r 2 ϭ 0.30) followed by soil order (r 2 ϭ
0.21) and then horizon designation (r 2 ϭ 0.10). Out
of the three grouping variables, taxonomic mineralogy/
CEC-activity may provide for the most homogeneous
soil groups to improve accuracy of estimating CEC. In
support of this, the mean RMSE values of the mineral-
ogy/CEC-activity class equations were significantly lower
that the mean RMSE of the soil order regression equa-
tions (P ϭ 0.036). This may suggest that the mineralogy/
CEC-activity class equations, as a group, might be more
accurate than the soil order regression equations. There-
fore, the mineralogy class/CEC-activity class prediction
equations should be used first, then the taxonomic order
equations. However, there would be some soils where
CEC would not be predicted if only the mineralogy/
CEC-activity models were used in Table 1. If an equa-
tion does not exist for a mineralogy class (e.g., ferritic),
then the taxonomic order equations are recommended
to be used. This recommendation along with the pH
and organic C data breaks for the remaining equations
are presented in Fig. 1 as a decision tree. The tree is a
guide for using the regression equations. For a given soil
layer, if the soil pH is Ն5.5, then CEC is estimated.
If the organic C content is Ͼ8%, then the tree goes
through the data breaks for using the high organic C
predictive models. If the organic C content is Յ8%,
then the tree, first, uses the mineralogy/CEC-activity
class equations, and then the soil order equations. As
soon as the criteria match for a horizon, that particular
predictive model is used to estimate CEC. The decision
tree provides a CEC estimate for every soil layer with
a pH of Ն5.5, given that the pH, organic C content, and
soil classification are known.

classifications with an assigned CEC-activity class. The
breakdown of the soil classifications are: 2% of the
soil layers had Ͼ8% organic C, 29% had a taxonomic
mineralogy class other than mixed or siliceous, 44% had
a CEC-activity class, and 25% were estimated based on
the taxonomic soil order. Of the mineralogy classes,
smectitic was the most common. Superactive was the
most common CEC-activity class. All developed predic-
tion models were used except the vermiculitic mineral-
ogy class and Oxisol soil order equations. The coefficient
of determination (r 2) was 0.87 and RMSE was 6.176.
When the high organic C horizons (OC Ͼ 8%) were
excluded, the RMSE decreased to 4.494, while the r 2
remained the same. This indicates that the high organic
C predictive models are less reliable in predicting CEC.
The 95% confidence intervals about the slope were
0.952 to 1.004, which includes unity; there is no signifi-
cant difference between the slope and unity. The 95%
confidence intervals about the intercept were Ϫ0.001 to
1.292, which does include zero, which indicates the inter-
cept is not significantly different from zero. This suggests
that the regression models, in aggregate, can provide a
reasonable estimate of CEC with decreasing reliability
at greater organic C contents. Since these models are
based on Soil Taxonomy, it is critical that the soils are
classified correctly, especially the mineralogy and CEC-
activity classes. In soil survey, soil scientists will gener-
ally estimate the soil classification based on experience
and knowledge of the soils in the area, the morphology,
and maybe some lab data.
CONCLUSIONS
There are 12 family mineralogy class and four CEC-
activity class equations, and 10 taxonomic order equa-
tions. Six equations were developed for high organic C
content soil layers (grouped by pH and organic C con-
tent). In total, 28 unique predictions equations were
developed. Dominate variables used in the development
of the models were organic C content, clay and silt con-

on the pH, organic C content, and taxonomic soil classi-
fication. Validation results indicate that the prediction
equations in aggregate provide a reasonable estimate
of CEC for the range of soils considered here. These
models are not a replacement for direct measurements
in soil survey; measured CEC data are preferred. How-
ever, when measurements cannot be made, soil scientists
have the convenience of using these predictive models
to estimate CEC. As more data become available or
classifications are identified in the database, prediction
equations for the remaining taxonomic mineralogy
classes can be developed. Exploration of other modeling
methods may provide better estimates.
