[1 ] Previous studies noted the close association of
geologically very recent lava flows and fluvial channels
emanating from Cerberus Fossae. To assess these
relationships, we outline a model of magmatic dike
emplacement that involves 1) surface fractures and
localized volcanic eruptions, 2) attendant cryospheric
cracking to fracture the surface and release pressurized
groundwater confined beneath the cryosphere, 3) effusion of
water along a segment of the fracture to form Athabasca
Valles, and 4) heating of the regions adjacent to the dike to
cause melting and subsequent subsidence of the surface,
forming late-stage pits and depressions. Previous estimates of
the aqueous discharge were $1 – 2 Â 106 m3 s À1. Our models
show that this flux could be readily accommodated by flow
through adjacent dike-related cryospheric fractures at water
rise speeds of $60 m/s. The required aquifer permeability,
however, is far larger than commonly encountered over
similar depths and scales on Earth. This suggests that water
may be transported in the subsurface by mechanism more
efficient than porous flow, and/or that the previously
INDEX
proposed volume flux values are overestimates.

1. Introduction
[2] The Cerberus Plains of Mars have long attracted
attention as a site of geologically recent volcanic and fluvial
activity [e.g., Plescia, 1993]. Berman and Hartmann [2002]
conclude that fluvial channels (Figure 1) associated with
Athabasca Valles [Burr and McEwen, 2002] give a model
age of fluvial activity of less than 20 Myr. Burr et al.
[2002a, 2002b] concluded that water carving the fluvial
channels of Athabasca Valles emanated from Cerberus
Fossae, that flow rates (assuming bank-full flow) were
1 – 2 Â 106 m3 sÀ1, and that water must have collected in
the subsurface in a liquid state (groundwater) in order to
flow at their estimated discharge rates. Due to the lack of
broad collapse in the vicinity of the source region, they

inferred the source of this groundwater to be at least several
kilometers deep, and concluded that it was released along
extensional faults due to flexural loading.
[3] In this contribution we address the fundamental issues
raised by earlier works concerning 1) the role of regional
tectonic forces versus dike emplacement processes, and 2)
the mechanisms of lateral and vertical transport of subsur-
face water to the surface to form Athabasca Valles and
Cerberus Fossae. We conclude that dike emplacement
processes can explain the vast majority of features observed.
2. Dike Emplacement and Cryospheric Cracking
[4] The propagation of magma-filled cracks (dikes) from
magma source regions often culminates in the dike reaching
the surface to cause eruption of magma and the production
of lava flows (Figure 2a). Commonly, however, dikes or
portions of dikes approach the surface but do not reach it,
setting up an extensional near-surface stress field that can
produce surface fractures and graben (Figures 2a and 2b).
[5] Long graben systems are evidence for giant lateral
dike swarms radiating from major volcanic centers, with the
upper tips of the dikes being trapped at shallow depths by
the combined effects of magma density and regional stress
field. Wilson and Head [2002] summarized work by Rubin
[1992] to show that if the formation of a graben is induced
by dike injection, the mean width of the dike, Wd, is
approximated by (1.25 Y) and the depth to the dike top,
Zd, is approximated by (0.29 B), where B is the width and
Y is the depth of the fracture/graben. Analysis of the
topography of the fractures and graben at Cerberus Fossae
(Figure 2b) using MOLA data and shadow measurements
yield estimates of the dike width of $150– 250 meters and
depth to the top of the dike of $50– 225 meters, if the
structures are caused entirely by extension due to dike
intrusion. Thus, dike emplacement is a reasonable process
for producing near-surface stress fields and fractures capa-
ble of cracking the cryosphere and providing conduits for
subsurface groundwater to reach the surface.
[6 ] Evidence for this scenario comes from MOC
images and MOLA altimetry, which show lines of can-
didate volcanic spatter vents along the strike of the fossae
and spatter-fed lava flows emerging from these vents
(Figure 2a), fractures and narrow flat-floored graben
along the same strike (Figure 2b), and collapsed linear
segments with ridges on their floors interpreted to be the
tops of dikes (Figure 2c).

The friction factors fw and fs must be obtained recursively
using the formulae for fully turbulent flow [Schlichting,
Figure 1. MOLA topography showing the Athabasca
Valles source along Cerberus Fossae and the channel carved
by the water outflow. One degree equals $ 60 km.
[7] The topography in the Athabasca Valles source area
(Figure 1) [Burr et al., 2002b] shows that the water eroding
the channels emerges from a pair of fractures closely
aligned with one another along a strike of $N65°W and
totaling $30 –40 km in length. Surrounding the sources is a
broad shallow depression, $50 m deep, $10– 20 km wide
and $30 km along strike. The fissures strike approximately
at right angles to the $0.07° regional slope, and the
depression extends uphill for $4 km. We infer that the high
speed of the water emerging from the fracture caused water
to flow uphill for this distance before spreading sideways
and back downhill around the ends of the active fractures,
eroding the depression in the process.
[8] Let the vertical rise speed of the water in the fracture of
width W be V. Also let the initial speed of the water flowing
away from the fracture be U and its initial depth be Á. Water
rises in a fountain over the fracture and descends again to feed
a flow on both sides of the fracture. Conservation of energy
implies U = V, and continuity requires (2 V Á) = (V W ) so that
Á = (0.5 W ). Water can be considered incompressible over
the small range of pressure changes involved, and so in
flowing uphill against the regional slope until it comes to rest
after the distance D = $4 km, it trades decrements in its
kinetic energy (V dV ) against increments in its potential
energy (g sin a dX ) and work done against basal friction
([(fsV 2)/(2 Á)] dX ), where X is distance measured along the
ground surface, g = 3.74 m sÀ2 is the acceleration due to
gravity, sin a = sin 0.07° = 1.2 Â 10À3, and fs is the basal
friction factor. Equating these components and integrating

w
log10(W/E), where E is the scale height of surface roughness,
here taken as 1 mm. To estimate dP/dz we assume that the
aquifer feeding the fracture extends for a depth Z = $5 km
from the bottom of a trapping cryosphere of thickness C =
3 km [Clifford, 1993]. The water in the aquifer is pressurized
by the water table of the topographically higher Elysium
Rise and the Elysium Mons complex to the northwest,
which we assume extends to a height S = $5 km (one quarter
the height of the volcano) above the level of the breakout
point. Then dP/dz is $r g {[(S + C + Z)/(C + Z)] À 1} =
$2338 Pa mÀ1. Solving the above two equations we find
W = $2.8 m and V = $44 m sÀ1. The corresponding
friction factors are fs = 0.0039 and fw = 0.0033. The height of
the water fountain over the source fracture would have been
[V2/(2 g)] = $260 m, and the total water flux from the $30–
40 km long fracture would have been $4.4 Â 106 m3 sÀ1,
comparable to the range $1– 2 Â 106 m3 sÀ1 estimated by
Burr et al. [2002a]. The implied $28 m fracture would be
almost impossible to detect using current image data.
[9] Previous workers have noted that along many seg-
ments of Cerberus Fossae both lava flows and water floods
end abruptly at fossae margins (Figure 2a), strongly suggest-
ing that the present margins postdate lava and water flow.
Also, Burr et al. [2002b] and Berman and Hartmann [2002]
propose that some fractures postdate (cut) the lava flows
emanating from the fissures, suggesting that the fossae and
fractures are largely due to later regional tectonic stresses,
rather than dike emplacement and associated processes.
[10] In the dike emplacement scenario, however, these
features and structures are a natural consequence of the
associated processes following dike emplacement, cryo-
spheric cracking, and water flooding. Thus, we interpret
the large steep-walled depressions along the strike of
Cerberus Fossae (Figures 2a and 2b) to be due to late-stage
melting of the ice-saturated cryosphere adjacent to the dike,
drainage, and subsequent collapse of the fracture and the
floor of the graben to enlarge the trough and destroy
evidence of the initial vent (Figures 3b and 3c). Heat
conducted from the dike would melt ice out to about half
the dike width on either side, i.e. the melting zone width
would be double the dike width. If ice occupies pore space
amounting to 25% of the volume of the crustal rocks, then
to cause the 300– 400 m subsidence observed it would be
necessary to remove the ice from a $2400 – 3200 m vertical
extent of crustal rock, assuming that only half of the pore
space was compacted during ice removal. This vertical
distance is sufficiently close to estimates of the cryosphere
thickness that we regard this as a viable mechanism.
[11] The steps in our model are illustrated in Figure 3.
First, the crust in the Cerberus Fossae/Elysium Planitia area
consists of a lava flow substrate overlying a megaregolith,
which in turn overlies fractured crustal bedrock. The upper
part of this column ($3 km) is predicted to be water-ice
saturated cryosphere [e.g., Clifford, 1993]. Underlying this
is a pressurized groundwater-saturated zone. Emplacement
of a dike to the shallow subsurface (Figure 3a) cracks the
cryosphere, causing magma to rise to the surface in a few
places, creating local surface eruptions, curtains of fire and
spatter-fed flows. Concurrently, the crack to the surface
provides a path for groundwater in the pressurized water-
saturated zone. Water courses to the surface mainly along

two $15– 20 km long portions of the crack (Figure 1),
creates fountains and ponds which extend $4 km upslope
from the cracks, and drain around the ends of the active
crack segments to carve the channels of Athabasca Valles
(Figure 3a). At the same time, the dike intruding into the
ice-saturated cryosphere is losing heat conductively into
the surrounding substrate, causing melting of the ice
(Figure 3b). This causes drainage of material adjacent
to the dike and collapse of the overlying substrate to
produce the irregular troughs (Figure 3c), destroying the
details of the fracture and near-vent lava and water flow
textures (Figures 2a and 2b). Thus, in our model, this
process is simply a consequence of the terminal phases of
the dike emplacement event rather than being due to later
tectonic activity as suggested by Burr et al. [2002a, 2002b]
and Berman and Hartmann [2002].

[12] We can relate the discharge up the vertical crack fed
by the aquifer to the aquifer properties using Darcy’s law.
The water volume flux per unit area (i.e. the Darcy
velocity), ui, is given by
ui 1⁄4 ðk=hÞð dP=dxÞ
ð4Þ
where k is the intrinsic permeability of the aquifer medium, h
is the dynamic viscosity of water, $1.5 Â 10À3 Pa s, and
dP/dx is the lateral pressure gradient (e.g., Carr [1979]) in
the aquifer. The main source of the pressure gradient is the
5 km water head in the Elysium Rise complex 700 km
away, so that dP/dx = [r g (5 km/700 km)] = $27 Pa mÀ1.
The common rock types in the source area are geologically
recent basaltic lava flow units that are underlain by
megaregolith grading down into fractured bedrock which
may have a high permeability [Clifford, 1993]. To illustrate
a likely maximum estimate of the available water flux we
assume that the aquifer has properties similar to that of
porous gravel, with k up to $10À7 m2 [Turcotte and
Schubert, 2002]. Then ui = 1.8 mm sÀ1. The total discharge
from the aquifer into the vertical crack is this velocity
multiplied by the inferred 30– 40 km total horizontal crack
length and the assumed 5 km vertical extent of the aquifer,
i.e. $3 Â 105 m3 sÀ1. This value is nearly an order of
magnitude smaller than the estimate by Burr et al. [2002a,
2002b] despite the fact that we are using maximum estimates.
[13] If the fissure length were greater than our estimated
30 – 40 km total length, this would influence the flux.
However, even doubling the fissure length would still result
in a shortfall by a factor of $2. To obtain a flux of 106 m3 sÀ1
(the lower end of the range estimated by Burr et al. [2002a,
2002b]) into the $35 km horizontal length of active fracture
from an aquifer assumed to be 5 km thick, the Darcy velocity
(i.e. the water volume flux per unit area) would have to be
$10 mm sÀ1, implying an aquifer permeability of $5.6 Â
10À7 m2, which is several times larger than the largest
permeability commonly encountered on Earth, $10À7 m2.
In fact, typical permeabilities on Earth for regional scale
Darcy flow are $10À14 m2 [Clifford, 1993], several orders of
magnitude smaller. An alternative explanation is that water is
not flowing by porous flow, but via some other mechanism
such as a large-scale, horizontally-interconnected fracture
system. Another possible explanation is that the volume flux
estimates by Burr et al. [2002a, 2002b] are too large. In their
original estimates, Burr et al. [2002a] used MOLA topog-
raphy of the channel, Manning’s equation modified for
martian gravity, and assumed bankfull flow, acknowledging
that the estimate may thus be ‘‘erroneously large’’. The
assumption that the presently-observed channels were
bank-full would overestimate the flux if any channel floor
erosion had taken place during the flood event.
3. Conclusions
[14] In our model, dike emplacement produces 1) sur-
face fractures and localized volcanic eruptions, 2) atten-
dant cryospheric cracking to fracture the surface and
release pressurized groundwater confined beneath the
cryosphere, 3) effusion of water along an observed 30–
40 km-long segment of the fracture to form Athabasca
Valles, and 4) heating of the regions adjacent to the dike
to cause melting and subsequent subsidence of the surface,
forming the observed late-stage pits and linear depres-
sions. Although it is plausible that most or all of the key
observed features occurred in a single intrusive and
eruptive phase, it is highly likely that multiple intrusive
phases would have occurred in this environment, as is
typical on the Earth [e.g., Rubin, 1992]; such repeated
events often lead to locally complex stratigraphic relation-
ships (e.g., Figure 3c).
[15] Our model shows that previously estimated aqueous
discharge fluxes for Athabasca Valles fluvial channels ($1 –
2 Â 106 m3 s À1) can be readily accommodated by flow
through a dike-related cryospheric fracture $2 m wide, at
water rise speeds of $60 m/s. However, these values require
aquifer permeability that is far larger than commonly
encountered on Earth, suggesting that subsurface mecha-
nisms more efficient than porous flow may be involved,
and/or that the previously proposed volume flux values are
overestimates.
