Abstract
Survival within macrophages is a central feature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis. Despite significant advances in
identifying new immunological parameters associated with mycobacterial disease, some basic questions on the intracellular
fate of the causative agent of human tuberculosis in antigen-presenting cells are still under debate. To get novel insights
into this matter, we used a single-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method to investigate the
potential cytosolic access of M. tuberculosis and the resulting cellular consequences in an unbiased, quantitative way.
Analysis of thousands of THP-1 macrophages infected with selected wild-type or mutant strains of the M. tuberculosis
complex unambiguously showed that M. tuberculosis induced a change in the FRET signal after 3 to 4 days of infection,
indicating phagolysosomal rupture and cytosolic access. These effects were not seen for the strains M. tuberculosisDRD1 or
BCG, both lacking the ESX-1 secreted protein ESAT-6, which reportedly shows membrane-lysing properties.
Complementation of these strains with the ESX-1 secretion system of M. tuberculosis restored the ability to cause
phagolysosomal rupture. In addition, control experiments with the fish pathogen Mycobacterium marinum showed
phagolysosomal translocation only for ESX-1 intact strains, further validating our experimental approach. Most importantly,
for M. tuberculosis as well as for M. marinum we observed that phagolysosomal rupture was followed by necrotic cell death
of the infected macrophages, whereas ESX-1 deletion- or truncation-mutants that remained enclosed within
phagolysosomal compartments did not induce such cytotoxicity. Hence, we provide a novel mechanism how ESX-1
competent, virulent M. tuberculosis and M. marinum strains induce host cell death and thereby escape innate host defenses
and favor their spread to new cells. In this respect, our results also open new research directions in relation with the
extracellular localization of M. tuberculosis inside necrotic lesions that can now be tackled from a completely new
perspective.

particularity is thought to be linked to the capacity of the bacterium
to persist and replicate within macrophages [4,5]. However, as has
been recently reported by cryo-immunogold electron microscopy,
other cellular mechanisms that involve translocation of M.
tuberculosis from the phagosome into the cytosol of the infected host
cell might play crucial roles at later time points of the infection
process [6]. In the same study it was shown that the attenuated

Introduction
The intracellular localization of bacterial pathogens has impor-
tant consequences for the sensing by the host and the induced host
immune responses. Hence, numerous studies have investigated the
intracellular niche of the microbes. Particularly, phagolysosome
fusion is a central cellular mechanism used by host cells to cope with
infection. Intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis are
known to avoid lysosomal fusion through the manipulation of host
signal transduction pathways [1]. Following phagocytosis by a host
macrophage and/or dendritic cell, M. tuberculosis typically resides in
a phagosomal compartment that maintains many characteristics of
an early endosome. The maturation towards an acidified phago-
lysosome is blocked or retarded by M. tuberculosis [2,3]. This

Mtb Phagosomal Rupture Induces Host Cell Death
Author Summary Results
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most life- Mycobacterial strains express and display beta-lactamase
threatening pathogens of all time. Despite the develop- activity
ment of vaccines and antibiotics, this pathogen is still a 
major public health problem. Also the HIV epidemic has an 
important impact on the rise of M. tuberculosis infections 
since immunodeficient people are highly susceptible. 
Commonly, M. tuberculosis has been thought to reside in 
a membrane-bound compartment within its host cells 
during the entire infection cycle from invasion to cell 
death. Using a fluorescence-based method, we provide 
evidence that M. tuberculosis is able to rupture its 
membrane-bound compartment and gain access to the 
host cytosol, where it can elicit cell death. Furthermore, we 
show that this effect is dependent on a functional type VII 
secretion system named ESX-1. Most importantly, we were 
able to track the dynamics of infection to understand the 
consequences of M. tuberculosis phagosomal rupture. This 
revealed that phagosomal rupture results in cell toxicity 
and host cell death involving necrosis. Together, our data 
provide a new angle in the worldwide fight against M. 
tuberculosis and could lead to new approaches in the 
development of innovative treatments. 
The aim of our study was to analyze the capacity of selected
mycobacteria to reach the cytosol during macrophage infection via
a robust, sensitive and quantitative approach at the single cell
level. For this, we had to adapt our FRET based reporter that was
previously used to monitor the intracellular localization of
Salmonella and Shigella species [11] (Figure S1) to the slowly
growing mycobacteria. In the host cell, membrane permeable
CCF-4-AM molecules diffuse freely across the cellular plasma
membrane, are subsequently trapped in the cytosol and excluded
from endosomes and other organelles by anion conversion into
CCF-4 upon cytosolic esterase action. The use of this cytosolic
probe relies on the bacterial expression and exposure of beta-
lactamase. Cleavage of CCF-4 by beta-lactamase-expressing
bacteria leads to a switch of the FRET signal from 535 nm
(green) to 450 nm (blue) upon 405 nm excitation. As mycobacteria
are naturally resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as
ampicillin, due to the constitutive expression of endogenous
beta-lactamases [21], we assumed that this activity could be
exploited by our assay. To ascertain that the selected mycobac-
terial strains showed the expected beta-lactamase activity, we first
demonstrated their capacity to cleave the colorimetric beta-
lactamase substrate nitrocefin (data not shown), and then
evaluated their cleavage of the CCF-4 probe in vitro by fluorimetry.
As shown in Table 1 and Figures S2A–C (in Supporting
Information), all tested strains displayed the necessary enzymatic
activity allowing us to follow the intracellular behavior of each
strain in real-time during the process of infection of human
macrophages. We decided to use the THP-1 human cell line as a
host cell model because upon addition of phorbol-myristate-
acetate (PMA) it differentiates from a cell with the characteristics
of monocytes to one with characteristics of macrophages.
Therefore, this cell line depicts a high state of differentiation.
Our experimental protocol started with the infection of THP-1
The translocation-model of van der Wel and colleagues
has the potential to explain a series of observations in conflict
with the often-repeated concept of M. tuberculosis remaining
enclosed in endosomal compartments that resist maturation and
acidification. Especially, it reconciled the MHC class I presen-
tation of M. tuberculosis antigens, and the increased CD8
responses during M. tuberculosis infection [9]. Nevertheless the
proposed model of phagosomal escape of M. tuberculosis has
remained controversial due to the complexity to interpret the
results entirely based on ultrastructural observations. Hence, it
still awaits broad acceptance by the scientific community through
independent studies and alternative experimental techniques
[6,10].
This situation prompted us to investigate the potential
phagosomal escape of M. tuberculosis and closely related mycobac-
teria by the means of a recently developed fluorescence
microscopy approach that proved to be a powerful tool to
investigate the rupture of host endocytic vacuolar membranes
during the cell invasion by Gram-negative pathogens [11,12]. This
assay requires the loading of host cells with a chemical probe that
is trapped within the host cytoplasm and sensitive to fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements [13,14], and a
beta-lactamase activity present on the cell surface of bacteria.
FRET image analysis of single infected cells can be performed in
live or in fixed cells, and the intracellular localization of the
bacterial pathogen can be quantified with high precision via
automated image analysis tools.
We took advantage of the BlaC mediated intrinsic resistance of
M. tuberculosis, BCG, Mycobacterium marinum and BlaS of Mycobac-
terium smegmatis to beta-lactam antibiotics [15–17] that worked in
conjunction with our FRET assay. Proteome analyses have
identified BlaC as a membrane-associated protein [18] containing
a lipobox motif in its signal sequence that predicts membrane-
anchored cell envelope localization [19,20]. This feature allowed
us to follow the cytosolic contact of selected mycobacteria over a
given time course, to monitor its consequences and to link
phagosomal rupture with the pathogenic potential of the tested
bacterial species.

cells by mycobacteria. Then, upon loading of cells with CCF-4 it
was possible to discriminate exclusive phagosomal location or host
cytosol access by the change of the FRET signal. Finally, using
automated microscopy and dedicated image analysis algorithms,
quantification was achieved on hundreds to thousands of cells for
dozens of conditions in parallel.
Cytosolic contact of M. marinum is dependent on ESAT-
6/CFP-10 secretion
We decided to take a closer look at the molecular requirements
for phagolysosomal rupture of M. marinum by using a M. marinum M
strain variant that was reported to be impaired for the secretion of
ESAT-6 and CFP-10 and has been named M. marinum MVU [22]
(Figure S4A). As shown in Figures 1A and S3A-F, this strain did not
induce a FRET shift within the infected macrophages, suggesting
that it was unable to reach the cytosol of the macrophage. This
effect was very strong as determined by automated image
quantification of 216 randomly imaged cells after 48 h of infection
(Figure 1C); not even a single infected macrophage of the inspected
cells showed an increase in the cytoplasmic 450/535 nm emission
ratio during the course of infection for early (Figure S2A) or late
(Figure 1A) time points, although the MOIs were the same as for the
ESAT-6 secretion-intact M. marinum M strain. In agreement with
previously published data [23,24] our results indicate that the
cytosolic translocation phenotype of M. marinum is dependent on
intact ESAT-6 secretion. This necessity is corroborated by
quantitative analyses depicted in Figures 1C, S2D–F (ratio
distribution was stalled at 1 throughout infection).
M. marinum gains rapid access to the cytosol of
macrophages
At first, we compared the translocation capacities of M. marinum
with M. smegmatis to evaluate the adaptability of our assay to
mycobacteria. THP-1 cells were infected by M. smegmatis (at 37uC)
or M. marinum expressing DsRed (at 30uC) at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 1 (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1A, the M.
marinum DsRed induced the switch of the FRET signal from
535 nm to 450 nm, indicating rupture of the phagosome and
contact with the cytosol after 24 h to 48 h of infection. Strikingly,
after 48 h of infection, virtually all the infected cells turned blue,
and only the uninfected cells remained green. On the contrary,
infection of the THP-1 cells with M. smegmatis did not result in a
switch of the fluorescent FRET signal showing that the bacteria
remained trapped within intact phagolysosomes. These results
were corroborated by quantitative analysis (Figure 1B), via a
dedicated algorithm segmenting individual host cells and measur-
ing both fluorescent channels [11]. While low fluorescent ratios
(around the value of 1) indicated the presence of membrane-
enclosed bacteria, high ratios (above 1) showed the presence of
cytosolic bacteria. Indeed, after 24 h of infection with M. marinum
DsRed, ratios went up to 3 and even reached 5 after 48h. It is
noteworthy that for M. marinum similar effects were already

done randomly and automatically for each condition on 36 fields to follow the FRET signals and the fluorescent bacteria. Data represented in panels B

with the cytosol starting from day 3 onwards (Figure 2D). It is of
note that in some cells with no apparently visible red bacteria a
FRET switch was measured due to the automated focusing on the
equatorial plane of the inspected cells during image acquisition.
Quantification of the imaging data revealed a gradual increase of
the 450/535 nm ratios over the observed time course for M.
tuberculosis to reach 2.5 (Figure 2D), whereas ratios remained at a
ratio of 1 for BCG (Figure 2C) until the end of infection at day 10.
Our data obtained with BCG are very similar to the data obtained
with uninfected or paraformaldhyde (PFA)-killed bacteria (Figures
S5A–D). As in the experiments with M. marinum and M. smegmatis
marinum, these tubercle bacilli display a very long infection cycle in
macrophages that can last up to 1 or 2 weeks depending on the
MOI. THP-1 cells were infected with BCG DsRed or M.
tuberculosis DsRed at 37uC at an MOI of 1 for a 10 day time
course. As shown in Figure 2A, BCG was unable to induce a
FRET switch indicating that it remained in a membrane-enclosed
compartment for the whole course of the experiment, and the
same was found for the BCG::pYUB412 vector control strain (data
not shown). In contrast, M. tuberculosis was progressively found
within macrophages displaying a FRET signal switch from
535 nm to 450 nm, indicating phagosomal rupture and contact

all acquired images were randomly chosen by the computer
driving the microscope, and subsequently were automatically
analyzed by our analytical pipeline. Taken together, our results
suggest that M. tuberculosis is indeed able to enter into the cytosol
during macrophage infection of multiple days, while BCG does
not manifest this faculty, even after prolongated infection. M.
tuberculosis thus shows a delayed but otherwise similar intracellular
behavior as M. marinum, whose faculty to translocate into the
cytosol of host cells is well established [23–25].
fluorescent marker WGA, we observed that upon infection with
M. tuberculosis or BCG::RD1 the number of THP-1 cells decreased
progressively from day 4 to day 10, which was much less
pronounced for macrophages infected with mycobacterial strains
that did not cause phagosomal rupture (Figure 4A). Live/Dead
Pacific Blue staining in combination with FLICA poly-caspase
staining and flow cytometry of THP-1 cells at day 7, when strain-
specific differences were most pronounced (Figure 4A), confirmed
that rupture-proficient strains caused more extensive host cell
death. Only 2–4% of the cells infected with M. tuberculosis, M.
tuberculosisDRD1::RD1 and BCG::RD1 were found viable, i.e.
without any apoptosis or necrosis marker compared to 10–20%
viable cells in non-infected cultures or those infected with M.
tuberculosisDRD1, BCG or BCG::RD1-ESAT-6D84–95 (Figure 4B).
Similar results were obtained when BCG and M. tuberculosis were
tested with necrosis marker 7-AAD at day 5 by flow cytometry
(Figure S6). Hence, our data support the hypothesis that
cytotoxicity is linked with access to the host cytosol. Inversely,
cytotoxicity was profoundly attenuated when the strains carried
genetic lesions that prevented disruption of the macrophage
phagolysosome.
To exclude that cell death alone leads to a FRET signal switch,
we induced cell death in the THP-1 cells in multiple ways and
found that no FRET change occurred under these conditions
(Figures S7A, B,). We also investigated the capacity of mycobac-
terial strains to gain access to the cytosol upon chemical induction
of host cell necrosis. For this purpose THP-1 macrophages were
infected with BCG at a MOI of 1 prior to induction of necrosis by
high concanavalin A concentration (100 mg/ml) for 24 h or 48 h
(Figure 5). As shown in Figure 5A, concanavalin A did elicit
necrosis as seen by propidium iodide nuclei staining. Nevertheless,
induction of necrosis did not lead to contact of BCG with the host
cytosol, as suggested by the absence of a FRET signal change
during the course of the experiment (Figures 5A–C). Similarly, the
concanavalin A induced necrosis conditions did not change the
faculty of M. tuberculosis and BCG::RD1 to cause FRET switches
only at later timepoints of infection. Samples taken at an early time
point (24 h) exclusively showed low 450/535 nm ratios (Figures
S8A–B) and the same was true for comparable infection conditions
when red fluorescent M. tuberculosis and BCG strains were imaged
(Figure S9).
Together, our data suggest that phagosomal rupture induced by
mycobacterial pathogens and induction of cytotoxicity are two
cellular events that are intimately linked. From the observed
timescale and the performed functional assays, the sequence of
events can be deduced suggesting that cytosolic contact of M.
tuberculosis precedes and triggers host cellular death. We propose
that these observations are highly relevant for a better under-
standing of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the
pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis as a human pathogen.
M. tuberculosis ESX-1 deletion mutant resides in
phagosomes
Based on results from previous reports and our results with the
M. marinum ESAT-6/CFP-10 secretion null mutant (MVU), we
decided to also test an M. tuberculosis ESX-1deletion mutant (M.
tuberculosisDRD1) [26], which lacks a functional ESX-1 secretion
system (Figure S4B). In the observed time course using an MOI of
1, we obtained similar results as for BCG, depicted by the absence
of a FRET ratio switch to higher values (Figures 3A, D). This
means that the ESX-1 deletion mutant bacteria reside in the
phagosome until the end of our experimental time course at day
10, emphasizing that ESX-1 effectors represent secreted key
factors that allow M. tuberculosis to gain access to the host cytosol.
We also complemented M. tuberculosisDRD1 with the genomic
region encompassing the ESX-1 cluster of M. tuberculosis (M.
tuberculosisDRD1::RD1; Figure S4B) and obtained similar results as
for the M. tuberculosis strain in the FRET analysis (data not shown).
ESAT-6-secreting BCG::RD1 gains access to the cytosol in
macrophages
In order to further investigate whether the involvement of the
ESAT-6 and the ESX-1 secretion system is crucial to trigger the
vacuolar rupture of mycobacteria, we tested recombinant
BCG::RD1, a BCG strain that expresses and secretes ESAT-6
and CFP-10 due to the integration of a 32 kb genomic region
encompassing the ESX-1 cluster of M. tuberculosis (Figure S4B)
[27,28]. In a time course experiment at a MOI of 1, this
recombinant strain showed a similar phenotype as the one
observed during M. tuberculosis infection. Quantitative analyses
showed that a gradual increase of the number of infected cells with
higher FRET ratios gradually increased starting from day 3 after
infection (Figures 3B, 3E). This demonstrates that the ESX-1-
complemented BCG::RD1 strain progressively gained access to
the host-cell cytosol. In contrast, the use of the BCG::RD1-ESAT-
6D84–95 strain that expresses and secretes truncated ESAT-6
(Figure S4B), showed no switch of the FRET ratio to higher values
throughout the time course, indicating the absence of bacteria in
the cytosol during the measured infection period (Figures 3C, 3F).
These findings indicate that the cytosolic contact observed upon
complementation of BCG with ESX-1 did not occur when 12
amino-acids were deleted from the secreted ESAT-6 molecule,
emphasizing the importance of ESAT-6 and its C-terminal region
as an effector involved in phagosomal rupture.
Discussion
Taking advantage of recently developed tools that allow the
quantitative analysis of vacuolar rupture and cytosolic entry of
beta-lactamase exposing bacteria, we provide unbiased evidence
that M. marinum and M. tuberculosis gain access to the cytosol of
infected THP-1 macrophages. These findings help to clarify the
long-standing controversy of phagosomal escape of mycobacteria.
While studies in the eighties and early nineties [29–31] showed
some evidence of M. tuberculosis in the cytosol using traditional
electron microscopy, these results remained to be confirmed by
other research groups due to the lack of reliable techniques. This
situation resulted in the paradigm of M. tuberculosis residing
Phagosomal rupture is followed by host cell death
As depicted in Figures 2D and 3E, we observed that upon
infection with M. tuberculosis strains that cause phagosomal rupture,
the total number of THP-1 cells diminished extensively over the
time course of the experiment, suggesting that mycobacteria-
induced phagosomal rupture and cytosolic contact leads to host
cell death. Strikingly, we observed this phenomenon also for M.
marinum, which induced cell death within 48 h (Data not shown).

generally within endomembrane compartments along the endo-
cytic route avoiding maturation and acidification of its niche.
Although the model of exclusive phagosomal containment is in
agreement with the fact that M. tuberculosis induces strong CD4+ T-
cell responses, which is a typical feature of MHC II class
presentation of peptides from phagocytosed pathogens [32], M.
tuberculosis also elicits pronounced CD8+ T-cell responses [9]. The
latter require proteasome-degraded cytosolic proteins to be
presented via MHC I class molecules. Furthermore, M. tuberculosis
infection also triggers type I interferon responses [33], and NLRP3
inflammasome activation, where ESAT-6 has been proposed to
facilitate the diffusion of immunomodulatory PAMPS (Pathogens-
Associated Molecular Patterns) to the cytosol resulting in enhanced
caspase 1 activation [34]. Thus, immunological data clearly
suggest that mycobacterial constituents appear and are processed
within the cell host cytoplasm during infection.
A plausible way to interpret these findings takes into account
that intracellular mycobacterial pathogens rupture the phagoso-
mal membrane and translocate to the cytosol at some stages of the
infection and thereby initiate the cytosolic recognition pathways.
Evidence for such mycobacterial translocation was reported for M.
marinum, which behaved similar to Shigella flexneri forming actin
comet tails inside the host cytoplasm [25]. More recently, potential
phagosomal escape of M. marinum was also linked to the formation
of the ejectosome [35], and/or the trapping of the pathogens
within septin cages [36].
For M. tuberculosis novel ways of sample preparation under cryo-
conditions and immuno-gold staining were employed to investi-
gate the intracellular pathogen localization challenging the
common view of the exclusive phagosomal localization of M.
tuberculosis [6]. However, the subject has remained controversial,
and the study of phagosomal rupture using independent
techniques is of major scientific interest [10]. In this respect, our
fluorescence microscopy-based approach for live and fixed
samples bring new quantitative insight into this phenomenon
using an alternative simple, specific and sensitive experimental
approach. Our data provide evidence that phagosomal rupture
and contact with the host cytoplasm occurs at a species time course
during the infection process.
This observation is even more significant as such rupture was
never observed for the different mutant strains impaired for
ESAT-6 and CFP-10 secretion (Figures 2A, 3A), thereby
demonstrating that the observed effects did not occur at random,
but in a biologically relevant fashion. Strikingly, BCG devoid of
the ESX-1 secretion system due to deletion of the RD1 region [7]
was unable to induce a change in the 450/535 nm ratio, whereas
the ESX-1 complemented BCG::RD1 strain under the same
experimental conditions clearly induced a change in the ratio from
green to blue, indicating cytosolic contact (Figures 3B, 3E). These
results extend previous reports on the potential involvement of the
ESX-1 system showing that the ESX-1 system is a central
component required for phagosomal rupture. Belonging to the
recently described type VII secretion systems [37,38], ESX-1 is
one of the five ESX systems in M. tuberculosis, designated ESX-1 to
ESX-5, that is well known for its involvement in virulence and
specific immune responses [39]. Indeed, M. tuberculosis, M. bovis
and/or M. marinum mutants lacking an intact ESX-1 secretion
system or its substrates have been shown to be attenuated in
cultured macrophages and animal models of infection, thereby
exhibiting defects in cell to cell spread, altered cytokine profiles
[23,26,40–42] or phagosome maturation arrest [43]. Furthermore,
it has been suggested that ESAT-6 secreted by M. marinum could
play a direct role in producing pores in membranes of the vacuoles
containing mycobacteria, facilitating the escape of M. marinum
PLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org
from the vacuole to the cytosol and cell to cell spread [44]. Similar
observations were made with purified ESAT-6 from M. tuberculosis
that destabilized and lysed artificial lipid bilayers and liposomes
[26,45].
A more distantly related ESX-1 system is also present in M.
smegmatis, where it is thought to serve as a putative conjugation
system [46]. As M. smegmatis is an avirulent, saprophytic and fast-
growing mycobacterium that did not show any phagosomal
translocation in our assay, it is possible that ESAT-6 and CFP-10
from M. smegmatis, which share only 60–70% amino acid identities
with their homologues from M. tuberculosis might not fulfill the
same function(s) and/or might miss potential interaction partners.
Inspection of available genome data showed that M. smegmatis is
not the only non-pathogenic fast-growing mycobacterium carrying
an orthologous ESX-1 system. Other species, such as Mycobacterium
vanbaalenii (GenBank: CP000511), Mycobacterium gilvum (CP000656),
Mycobacterium sp. JLS (GenBank: CP000580), Mycobacterium sp.
KMS (GenBank: CP000518) and Mycobacterium sp. MCS (Gen-
Bank: CP000384) also encode ESX-1 systems that resemble ESX-
1 in M. tuberculosis in gene content and gene order. In contrast,
these fast-growing mycobacterial species lack orthologs of the
EspACD locus that in M. tuberculosis is involved in the regulation of
ESX-1 mediated virulence [47–50]. As the EspACD locus is
present in M. marinum, M. leprae, and M. tuberculosis, which have all
been described as translocation-proficient mycobacteria [6,24,25],
it might well be that phagosomal rupture requires interaction of
ESX-1 and EspACD proteins. The CCF-4 based experimental
approach presented here will be helpful to investigate this question
in the near future.
We show that mycobacterial phagosomal rupture precedes host
cell death (Figures 4, 5, S8 and S9). Using necrosis markers, like
propidium iodide we found that infected host cells harboring
cytoplasmic bacteria tested positive for necrosis within one to two
days upon FRET signal switch, however cells appeared as ‘‘empty
bags’’ at the very late time points complicating the interpretation
of the results. Flow cytometry confirmed that most of M. tuberculosis
and BCG::RD1 infected cells stained positively for necrosis and/or
apoptosis markers, whereas this effect was substantially reduced for
infection with M. tuberculosisDRD1 and BCG (Figures 4B, S6).
Triggering cell death in infected macrophages is in agreement with
studies suggesting the role of the ESX-1 system during this event
[24,26,51]. Independent studies have investigated the different
mechanisms of host cell death that may have an impact on
triggering the immune response [52]. Depending on the individual
cell cycle of each of the involved bacteria, it might be sufficient if
only a few bacteria become cytosolic to induce the initiation of cell
death supporting the hypothesis of Fortune and Rubin on
phagosomal escape of M. tuberculosis, who suggested that the
cytosol might only be a brief stop on the way to escape from the
intracellular environment altogether [10]. Importantly, in many
hosts, large numbers of bacteria have been found to be
extracellular, such as those found in necrotic caseous lesions.
Thus, the paradigm of intracellular growth might represent only a
part of the life cycle of the infectious organisms [10]. Such a
scenario would also explain why only a certain percentage of
bacteria was previously found in the cytosol by EM and other
techniques due to the experimental procedures.
In conclusion, our presented data on the ESX-1-dependent
potential of M. marinum, BCG::RD1 and M. tuberculosis to change
the FRET signal in an ESX-1-dependent manner is in excellent
agreement with previous studies that have suggested an involve-
ment of ESAT-6 in membrane and/or cell lysis. The similarities
with the FRET changes caused by IpaB-secreting Shigella flexneri
[11,53] suggest that these mycobacterial strains also gain cytosolic

Mtb Phagosomal Rupture Induces Host Cell Death
Before use, cells were washed twice with fresh medium. M.
tuberculosis and BCG strains were grown to mid-log phase in 7H9
containing albumin dextrose catalase (ADC, Difco) medium at
37uC. Cultures were harvested, washed, resuspended in PBS and
gently sonicated to avoid clumping. The concentration of each
strain was determined by OD600 measurement. Then PMA-
differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with M. tuberculosis and
BCG suspensions at a MOI of 1:1 in RPMI medium during for
2 h at 37uC with 5% CO2. After 2 h, the medium was removed
and cells were washed 3 times to remove extracellular bacteria
before the addition of fresh medium. Time course measurements
evaluating phagosomal rupture were done at days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and
10.
M. marinum strains were grown to mid-log phase in 7H9
containing ADC at 30uC. Cultures were harvested, washed,
resuspended in PBS and then filtered though a syringe. The
concentration of each strain was determined by OD600
measurement. Then PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were infect-
ed with M. marinum suspensions at an MOI of 1:1 in EM medium
(120 mM NaCl, 7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgCl2,
5 mM glucose and 25 mM Hepes at pH 7.3) for 2 h at 30uC.
After 2 h, the medium was removed and cells were washed 3 times
to remove extracellular bacteria before the addition of fresh EM
medium containing Hepes and 10% FBS. Time course measure-
ments to monitor the M. mariunum phagosomal rupture were done
at day 0, 1 and 2 to monitor the M. mariunum phagosomal rupture.
access via rupture and disassembly of phagosomal membranes, but
at later stages of infection. However, taking into consideration that
the reported ESX-1-dependent type I interferon response to
infection with M. tuberculosis occurs already 24 h post infection
[33], it is plausible that rupture of the phagosomal membrane is
preceded and/or initiated by pore-forming activity of ESAT-6,
which might allow small signalling molecules such as cyclic
diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) [54] or other PAMPs to
translocate prior to the escape of entire bacteria and thereby
trigger an early cytosolic host response. In any case, the ESX-1
mediated access to the cytosol seems to represent a major switch
for many cellular parameters and the resulting immune responses
[39,55], which are thus substantially different between BCG and
M. tuberculosis. Hence, infection experiments using BCG as a model
organism might have the disadvantage of potentially missing out
on this part of cellular responses that are linked to the cytosolic
access of the bacteria. The BCG::RD1 strain seems to represent a
good compromise, as it is much less virulent than M. tuberculosis,
but due to the access to the cytosol still elicits ESAT-6 specific
immune responses similar in quality and quantity to M. tuberculosis
[9]. This finding seems also to be an important feature for the
enhanced protective efficacy of BCG::RD1 or other ESX-1
complemented vaccine strains relative to BCG alone [27,56]. In
a more practical sense, our findings have direct relevance for the
design of new vaccines and the potential development of new
therapeutic intervention strategies that might target the ESX-1
secretion system. It is clear from our study that a more effective
vaccine strain should have the capacity to access to the cytosol of
target cells in order to induce the series of immunologic responses
ordinary BCG is unable to induce. A potential combination of the
properties of BCG and M. marinum might represent one novel
route to explore. Finally, the presented CCF-4 assay might also
represent a powerful new system that can be automated for cell-
based screening of larger compound libraries [57] in order to
identify molecules that can block phagosomal rupture and thereby
a whole series of events that are linked to the pathogenicity of one
of the most deadly pathogens of mankind.
Shigella flexneri and Salmonella typhimurium infection
Ampicilline-resistant bacteria were incubated overnight at 37uC
with shaking, diluted 1/100 in BTCS (for Shigella M90T-AfaI) or
LB broth (for Salmonella typhimurium), and incubated in the same
conditions for 2,25 h. The cultures were washed with PBS.
Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri were incubated with
0.1 mg/ml beta-lactamase (Sigma) or 0.1 mg/ml Atto594 beta-
lactamase, respectively, for 10 min. After PBS washing, cultures
were diluted in 10% FBS-containing DMEM/F12 (Gibco) and
added to the cells at a MOI of 100 at 37uC.
Materials and Methods
Labelling of soluble beta-lactamase
Labelling of beta-lactamase (Sigma) was obtained using Atto594
protein labelling kit (Fluka).
Bacterial strains, growth conditions
Wildtype and mutant strains of M. tuberculosis (H37Rv), M. bovis
BCG Pasteur 1173P2, M. marinum MVU, M. marinum M Dsred and
M. smegmatis (mc2 155) were grown in 7H9 liquid medium (Difco)
supplemented with albumin-dextrose-catalase (ADC, Difco) or on
solid Middlebrook 7H11 medium (Difco) supplemented with oleic
acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC). With the exception of M.
marinum, which was grown at 30uC, all other strains were
cultivated at 37uC. M. tuberculosis or M. marinum heat killed strains
were obtained by heating the sample at 95uC for 30 min. PFA-
fixed M. tuberculosis or M. marinum bacteria were obtained after
incubation with PFA 4% for 30 min. If required, the media were
supplemented with 20 mg/ml of kanamycin or 50 mg/ml of
hygromycin. Shigella flexneri (M90T-AfaI) was grown in BTCS
and Salmonella typhimurium was grown in LB broth.
CCF-4 assay to monitor mycobacterial vacuolar rupture
At the successive stages of the time course measurements, a mix
containing 50 mM CCF-4 substrate (Invitrogen) in EM containing
2.5 mM probenicid was added for 2 h at RT in the dark. Cells
were washed with PBS containing 2.5 mM probenicid before fixing
with PFA 4% for 30 min at RT in the dark. Cells were washed
before performing directly fluorescence imaging or additional
cellular staining.
Fluorescent tools and fluorescence imaging
The necrotic marker propidium iodide (Fluka) was used just
before fixation for 5 minutes at 2 mg/ml in PBS in the dark. The
cell membrane marker WGA 647 (Invitrogen) was used after
fixation at 2 mg/ml in PBS in the dark for 30 min. Samples were
imaged using an automated inverted fluorescent widefield
microscope Nikon Ti with 20X or 40X objective driven by
Metamorph. Picture acquisition was achieved randomly and
automatically for all measurements of this study on 36 to 49 fields
per condition. Samples were excited at 405 nm, and emission was
followed to determine the 450/535 nm intensity ratio. Automated
image analysis including cell segmentation and quantification was

Induction of cell death
Staurosporine (Sigma), cycloheximide (Sigma) and TNF-a (RD
systems) were used for inducing apoptosis whereas concanavalin A
(Sigma) and H2O2 (Sigma) were used for inducing necrosis.
Flow cytometry analysis
Two different flow cytometry assays were performed to evaluate
cell death caused by different M. tuberculosis and BCG strains at
later timepoints of infection. THP-1 cells were labeled with FLICA
Poly-Caspases (SR-VAD-FMK) marker (Immunochemistry Tech-
nologies), which detects apoptotic cells, and LIVE/DEAD Pacific
Blue Fixable Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen), which detects
necrotic cells, according to the manufacturer recommendations.
The stained cells were fixed overnight with 4% PFA and
cytometric data were acquired on a Cyan system, using the
Summit software (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France). Data
were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, OR, USA). A
parallel experiment was performed for BCG and M. tuberculosis
strains using 7-AAD staining (BD-Pharmingen) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The stained cells were fixed
overnight with 4% PFA and analyzed using a FACS ARIA III flow
cytometer and FlowJo software (Tree Star, OR, USA).

Biochemical analysis
M. tuberculosis strains or M. bovis BCG strains were grown in
liquid medium, at pH 7 for 7 days and 4 days for M. marinum
strains. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation. The superna-
tant was recovered after filtration through 0.22 mm pore size filters
(Millipore) and protease inhibitors were added (Complete EDTA
Free; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The cell
pellet was washed twice and resuspended in PBS. Cells were
ruptured by shaking with 106-mm acid washed-glass beads (Sigma)
for 8 min at speed 30 in a Mill Mixer (MM300; Retsch GmbH,
Haan, Germany). The whole cell lysate consisting of the
supernatant fraction recovered after filtration and debris were
removed by centrifugation at 17000 g for 30 min. Total protein
concentrations were determined by using Nanodrop. Samples
were subjected to NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris pre-cast gel (12%)
(Invitrogen) before blotting on iBlot Gel Transfer Stacks Mini
Nitrocellulose (Invitrogen) with iBlot Dry Blotting System.
Immunoblotting was performed with mouse monoclonal anti-
ESAT6 antibody (Hyb 76-8, Antibodyshop) and mouse monoclo-
nal anti-GroEL2 antibody as lysis control as described [58].
Antibodies against GroEL2 were received as part of National

Determination of beta-lactamase activity in vitro
Beta-lactamase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically with
100 mM nitrocefin (Calbiochem) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate
buffer at 37uC. Hydrolysis was monitored at 486 nm using a UV
spectrophotometer. The molecular extinction coefficient of
hydrolyzed nitrocefin at 486 nm is 20500 M21cm21. The rate
of nitrocefin hydrolysis by each protein was expressed as
micrograms of nitrocefin hydrolysed per minute per microgram
of protein.
Fluorimetric assays were performed in 1 ml PBS containing
50 mg/ml porcine esterase liver extracts (Sigma) and 100 nM
CCF-4-AM liveblazer (Invitrogen). The esterase was added to
cleave off the –AM ester moieties yielding fluorescent CCF-4.
Bacteria were washed with PBS and added to the mixture for 12 h
at 37uC in the dark. Soluble lactamase 1 mg/ml was used as a
