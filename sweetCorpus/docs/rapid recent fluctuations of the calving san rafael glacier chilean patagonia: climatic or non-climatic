ABSTRACT. Recent fluctuationsof the San Rafael Glacier
contrast in timing, direction and intensity with regional
trends of glacierbehaviour.In this paper,a link is identified
between the oscillation history, the topographic situation
and variations in winter precipitation. The San Rafael
Glacier is the lowest latitude tidewaterglacier in the world
with unusually high annual mean velocities. Since the late
nineteenth century, it has retreated and advanced rapidly
over a total distanceof 14km and is now 60 km2smallerthan
it was 100 years ago. Retreat at up to 300 m a-' during the
1980shaltedin 1990.Since then, a slightreadvancehas occur-
red at a time of acceleratedregionalretreat.Calvingglaciers
are known to respond indirectly to climate change, but
whereas some may oscillate in non-climatic, cyclical ways
over decadal and centurytimescales, the San Rafael Glacier
seems to respondrapidlyto changes in precipitation.The in-
fluence of calving dynamics has, at different times, both
damped and amplified the response to climate change, but
the topographicgeometry does not permit large-scale, non-
climatic fluctuations. The Holocene record of glacier be-
haviouris therefore probablyfree of calving anomalies.
Climate and calving glaciers in Patagonia
The oscillations of calving glaciers are often out of
phase with, or contrary to, trends of climate
change for reasons which are poorly understood
and yet important for valid interpretations of the
glacio-climatic record. This study examines the
possible causes of the rapid recent fluctuations of
the San Rafael Glacier, the fastest flowing outlet
glacier of the Patagonian icefields. The results of a
detailed investigation of calving dynamics at the
San Rafael Glacier are presented elsewhere (War-
ren et al., in prep.).
Glacier oscillations are often used as indications
of climate change, both in historic and geological
time. However, this is only valid if glaciers have
been responding directly to climate on the same
timescale as that of the investigation. If a particu-
lar ice mass is subject to processes that can cause it
to fluctuate in a climatically independent fashion,
then it is clear that a reliable climate signal cannot
be deduced from an uncalibrated record of its os-
cillation history. Iceberg calving is such a process
(Meier and Post 1987).
The stability of tidewater and freshwater calving
glaciers is more complex than that of non-calving
glaciers because more independent and depen-
dent variables are operative, some of which act in
feedback loops (Hughes 1986; Powell 1991). In-
stabilities introduced by the presence of calving
can decouple glacier behaviour from the climate
signal (Trabantet al. 1991) causing calving glaciers
to oscillate in ways unrelated to climate over
periods of decades to several centuries. These os-
cillations may be cyclical (Mann 1986; Porter
1989), driven predominantly by glacio-dynamic re-
sponse to water depths (Brown et al. 1982; Pelto
and Warren 1991), topography (Mercer 1961;War-
ren 1991), and sediment supply (Powell 1988;
Alley 1991) rather than climate. Such behaviour is
unsurprising, given that auto-oscillations are a
characteristic response of dynamical systems to in-
herent instability (Gaffin and Maasch 1991). The
body of evidence now available that shows that
calving glaciers may behave in non-climatic ways
(Warren 1992) indicates that the burden of proof
has shifted. The presumption must be that calving
glaciers respond only indirectly to climate forcing
unless it can be clearly demonstrated that climate
is the controlling variable.
While many outlet glaciers from the Patagonian
icecaps respond in a broadly direct manner to cli-
mate change (Aniya and Enomoto 1986), many of
the tidewater and freshwater calving glaciers in
Chile and Argentina have behaved asynchron-
ously relative to each other, to nearby non-calving
glaciers, and to climate during Holocene and re-
cent time (Aniya 1992; Aniya et al. 1992; Clapper-
ton and Sugden 1988; Mercer 1964, 1982; Naruse

and Aniya 1990,1992; Warren and Sugden, in
press). Resolving the balance between climatic
and non-climatic controls on the growth and decay
of the Patagonian icefields has wider significance
because Patagonia is a focus of debates concerning
the synchrony of climate change in the northern
and southern hemispheres during the Late Glacial
and Holocene (Hoganson and Ashworth 1992;
Markgraf 1991).
The San Rafael glacier
Regional setting
The San Rafael Glacier is a western outlet of the
North Patagonian Icefield (Figs. 1 and 2). Lying in
the 'Roaring Forties', the area is characterised by
a cool, wet climate most of the year (Caviedes
1990) and the frequent passage of rain-bearing
112
storm systems. Dense temperate rainforest
thrives, and deglaciated ground is recolonised by
vegetation within a few years. Although seasonal
variations in precipitation and temperature are
small, high interannual variation is characteristic
(Enomoto and Nakajima 1985), and precipitation
may fall as snow in any season, even when air
temperatures are above 0° C (Kondo and Yamada
1988). Consequently, ablation and accumulation
seasons vary greatly from year to year, and are
hard to define. The west side of the North Patago-
nian Icefield is characterised by a clear summer
rainfall maximum (Fujiyoshi etal. 1987) and winds
which, though frequent, are much less severe than
on the eastern side of the icefield (Ohata et al.
1985).
The region is seismically active. The study area
is at the southern end of the 1000 km-long zone
shaken by the magnitude 8.5 earthquake of May
1960, 'one of the most notable seismic events of
the century' (Plafker and Savage 1970:1001). In
the San Rafael area it caused over 2 m of subsi-

dence and the drowning of areas of low-lying forest
(Reed et al. 1988). The topography is dominated
by the fault scarp of the Liquine-Ofqui fault sys-
tem, an abrupt mountain wall which forms the
eastern side of the Laguna San Rafael.
Glacier description
The San Rafael Glacier is the lowest latitude tide-
water glacier in the world (46° 41'S, 73° 50'W), a
latitude equivalent to Geneva or Quebec, and is
the most active outlet glacier of the North Patago-
nian Icecap, draining about 19% of its total area
(Aniya 1988). Ice velocities of 22 m d-' have been
recorded near the terminus (Kondo and Yamada
1988) which place it alongside Jakobshavns Isbrae
in West Greenland (Echelmeyer and Harrison
1990) and Columbia Glacier in Alaska (Meier, per-
sonal communication) as one of the world's fastest
glaciers. Velocities at the calving front may reach
values as great as 48 m d-' over periods of a few
hours (Winchester, personal communication).
These high speeds are most probably driven by
heavy annual precipitation on the icefield at al-
titudes of 1000-1500 m. At the Laguna San Rafael,
precipitation exceeds 4000 mm a-' (Enomoto and
Nakajima 1985), while on the accumulation areas
of the Patagonian icefields it probably exceeds
8000 mm a-1 (Escobar et al. 1992) and may be as
high as 10,000 mm a-' (Fujiyosyhi et al. 1987). The
accumulation area of the San Rafael Glacier mea-
sures about 585 km2 (Aniya 1988), and net annual
accumulation is of the order of 3.5 m a' (Yamada
1987). The Equilibrium Line Altitude is estimated
to be 1200 m (Aniya 1988). Melt rates during the
summer reach mean rates of almost 7 cm d-' near
the terminus (Kondo and Yamada 1988).
The glacier terminates at a 3 km-long calving
cliff in the Laguna San Rafael in the Parque Na-
cional San Rafael (Fig. 3). The ice cliff is 30-70 m
high and stands in water 100-300 m deep. Calving
events from both above and below the waterline
occur every few minutes (Fig. 4), frequently pro-
ducing icebergs measuring tens and sometimes
hundreds of metres in length. The largest compo-
site events may be as great as 2 M m3 (Harrison
1992). During the summer, there are on average
over 400 calving events each day and the mean
daily calving flux exceeds 2 M m3 (Warrenet al., in
prep.). The Laguna San Rafael is linked to the sea
by the narrow channel of the Rio Tempanos, and
experiences a tidal range of 1-2 m. The Laguna is
50-100 m deep in most places, though deepening
considerably into the recently occupied glacial
channel (Nakajima et al. 1987).
Methods
The fluctuation history has been compiled from
published sources, maps, aerial photographs,
satellite imagery and field observations in the aust-
ral summers of 1991, 1992 and 1993. For frontal
and marginal changes during the last decade, a
series of paint marks made in January 1984 by
Kondo and Yamada (1988) were relocated. These
indicate the position of the northern end of the
calving cliff at that time, as well as several points
along 2 km of the northern valleyside. Other paint

marks left by climbing expeditions in 1990 indicate
the position of each end of the calving cliff in that
year. The precise latitude/longitude coordinates of
the south and north ends of the ice front were re-
corded with a Global Positioning System satellite
receiver, using averages of 35 individual fixes,
enabling precise future monitoring of ice margin
change. The bathymetry of the recently de-
glaciated channel area in front of the glacier was
recorded in 1992 with an echo sounder. Consecu-
tive individual soundings were taken along a series
of long- and cross-profiles, continuous profiling
being prohibited by the abundance of icebergs and
brash ice.

Results
Holocene and historical behaviour
At some time since the last glaciation, the glacier
advanced to fill the Laguna San Rafael, depositing
a massive double moraine arc 35 km long and typ-
ically about 15 m high which forms the shores of
the lagoon. These moraines, dubbed the Tem-
panos moraines by Muller (1959), were originally
thought to date from an advance 5000 years ago
(Heusser 1960, 1964) but they are now regarded as
probably older than that (Clapperton and Sugden
1988:187). The dates obtained by Heusser (1960)
imply that the Little Ice Age advance was the
greatest for at least 7000 years, indicating that the

Tempanos moraines may be Late Glacial in age as
suspected by Muller (1959). The Holocene frame-
work of climatic change and glacial history in
southern South America remains fluid (Clapper-
ton, in press).
Early historical records collected by Briiggen
(1950) and discussed by Casassa and Marangunic
(1987) and Grove (1988) indicate that in 1675 the
glacier was less extensive than today, occupying a
shoreline position. It advanced into the Laguna
San Rafael between 1742, when it was described
by John Byron, and 1766, by which time the ice
front was in water deep enough to initiate calving.
The Little Ice Age maximum was attained during
the middle of the nineteenth century (Lawrence
and Lawrence 1959). The first precise observa-
tions were made by Comandante Enrique Simp-
son in 1871, by which time the glacier had ad-
vanced an estimated 8.5 km since 1766 to form
what he described as a piedmont lobe (Brtiggen
1950:241). It was still in approximately the same
position in the mid-1880s when visited by Dr. Stef-
fen. The probable maximum extent at this time
and the subsequent oscillation history are shown
in Fig. 5. Commencement of retreat from the late
nineteenth century maximum was dated at the
prominent valleyside vegetation trimline to 1882
by Lawrence and Lawrence (1959). However, the

wide divergence of colonisation times in Patagonia
(Grove 1988;Warren and Sugden, in press) means
that this date must be regarded as indicative, not
absolute, until colonisation times are more pre-
cisely known.
7iventiethcentury behaviour
The twentieth century pattern of advance and re-
treat is summarised in Fig. 8.
1900-1935 (retreat): Retreat progressed discon-
tinuously, reaching the vicinity of the abandoned
hotel in about 1900, and forming a recessional
moraine in 1910 (Heusser 1964). Between 1905
and 1935, retreat totalled at least 6 km (Lliboutry
1956), or possibly as much as 7 km (Briiggen
1950:242). However, since the glacier was more
than half way across the Laguna in 1920 when ob-
served by the German explorer Dr. Reichert, the
period 1910-1920 must have seen either retreat
and readvance or a stillstand. Either way, retreat
between 1920 and 1935 must have progressed at a
mean rate of over 400 m a-1.
1935-1959 (advance): The mid-century behaviour
remains unclear. Lawrence and Lawrence (1959)
believe that the ice front was stable between 1935
and the late 1950s, whereas Lliboutry (1956:383)
states that there was an advance of 2 km between
1935 and 1945. Lliboutry's information is more
likely to be accurate, given his very extensive re-
search and exploration in the region. The first ae-
116
rial photographs, taken in 1945, clearly delimit the
ice front.
1959-1983 (retreat): In 1959, trees 30 years old
were being pushed over at the ice margin (Heusser
1960, 1964) and the glacier must therefore have
been slightly expanded relative to its 1945 config-
uration. The middle trimline of the three clearly
visible on the valleysides (Fig. 6) probably dates
from this time. In 1964 the margin was still 'pres-
sing close against the forest on the precipitous
slopes' (Shipton 1964:186), indicating that the
glacier was still close to its late 1950s extent at that
time. Slow retreat in the 1960s and early 1970s ac-
celerated dramatically thereafter, totalling 2 km
between 1975 and 1983 (Aniya and Enomoto
1986).
1983-1990 (retreat): The rock markings made in
ice-marginal locations in 1984 (Kondo and Yama-
da 1988) are now stranded high above the ice mar-
gin on the valley walls. They demonstrate that be-
tween 1984 and 1991 the glacier retreated at a net
rate of 215 m a-l, with vertical shrinkage near the
current site of the terminus of over 100 m (= -15 m
a'l). In 1992, 50 cm-high seedlings of Nothofagus
betuloides and N. nitida were found growing in this
recently deglaciated marginal zone on the north-
ern valleyside on bedrock that had been under ice
no more than 9 years before. Retreat rates be-
tween 1985 and 1990 peaked at 300 m a-1, com-
pared to the net retreat rate between 1974and 1985
of 200 m a-1 (Aniya 1988, 1992).

and one of the islands unco-
vered by the retreat.
1990-1993 (stability/advance): However, the rapid
retreat of the 1980s has now halted, and there are
indications that a slow advance may be commenc-
ing. At the north end of the ice cliff, at the ice/val-
leyside junction, advance of 10 m occurred be-
tween February 1991 and February 1992. The
northern section of the ice cliff evolved from being
straight or concave in plan to being convex be-
tween 1991 and 1992, and the mid-point of the cliff
advanced some 50 m. No further advance had oc-
curred by February 1993. At the south margin the
ice cliff now stands on bedrock at sea level (Fig. 7)
and the glacier flows round a large bedrock spur,
starving the southernmost portion of the front of
ice supply. A paint mark left by a climbing expedi-
tion in May 1990 indicates lateral melt-back of the
margin along the shoreline of c. 80 m since then.
However, the position of the ice cliff itself has not
changed significantly since 1991. The coordinates
of the ice cliff margins in February 1992 deter-
mined by satellite positioning are as follows:
North end: 46°40.6414 S South end:46°41.8358 S
73°50.7767W
73°51.3091W
The location at which the glacier's retreat has
stabilised is a point of slight valley narrowing rela-
tive to the channel up which the retreat has occur-
red. At its widest, the channel measures 2.7 km
whereas its width at the present ice front is 2.2 km.

Waterdepths
The bathymetric survey (Fig. 9) revealed a typical
steep sided glacial valley cross-section. Along the
middle of the channel, water depths average
around 200 m but increase nearer the ice front to
more than 250 m. The greatest recorded depth was
272 m but in three locations the depth exceeded
the capacity of the echo sounder, so the maximum
depth may be as much as 300 m. Despite this in-
crease in the depths along the long- profile towards
the ice front, the width-averaged water depths de-
crease slightly. The width-averaged depth across
the channel mouth is 140 m, increases to 150 m in
the middle of the channel, and then decreases to
138 m near the ice front.
The ice front is grounded in water deeper than
100 m along most of its length except at the shal-
lower southern end where rocky islets have been
exposed by the recent retreat. The southernmost
100 m of the front has now retreated to a shoreline
position (Fig. 7). For a further 150 m along the
cliff, water depths are clearly very shallow, less
than 20 m, because the fall of large ice pinnacles is

arrested as their base hits the sea floor, while smal-
ler calvings produce sediment-laden plumes of
spray. Large icebergs calved in this section cannot
float away but are grounded at the ice front until
melting reduces their draught. Localised flotation
may occur in the deepest sections, but the low ten-
sile strength of temperate ice forbids flotation of
the glacier snout; temperate ice 'calves before it
can float' (Powell 1988:72).
Twentiethcentury climate change
Figure 10 shows precipitation and temperature re-
cords from Cabo Raper and Puerto Aisen. They il-
lustrate the striking degree of interannual variabil-
ity. Temperatures have been oscillating around a
fairly stable long-term mean over a range of 4.5° C.
There is no evidence of recent warming. Tempera-
tures gradually fell during the 1980s, and the mean
summer temperature of 13.66° C for 1983-1991
was fractionally cooler (by 0.02° C) than that in the
1940s. Precipitation was high but extremely vari-

mainly by variation in the winter totals, the key
season for affecting glacier mass balance. The de-
cadal means (Table 1) reveal the extent of the var-
iability, the highest average of 2822 mm in the
1980s being two and a half times that for the 1960s.
Temperature and precipitation appear to have a di-
rect relationship with each other, so that when the
climate gets warmer, it gets wetter, and vice versa.
However, regional climatic gradients are excep-
tionally steep (Warren and Sugden, in press), and
this casts doubt over the relevance of remote cli-
mate records to the climatic trends around the
icefields themselves. Figure 11 presents the mean
annual temperature record over the last three de-
cades from three stations, two of them distant
from the icefields and one very close. Punta
Arenas and Puerto Aisen are both coastal sites and

of the icefields, while Torres del Paine is adjacent
to the southern end of the southern icefield in the
National Park of the same name. The records from
the two coastal stations are coherent with each
other, but at Torres del Paine mean temperatures
have fluctuated dramatically over a 7° C range with
trends contrasting sharply with the other records,
especially in the 1970s. Interestingly, the more re-
cent fluctuations have all been in phase, but the
earlier patterns demonstrate that the glaciers may
experience climatic changes which contrast mar-
kedly with the regional pattern both in magnitude
and trend.
Discussion
Regional fluctuation history
Any conclusions about the relationship between
climate change and the fluctuations of the San
Rafael Glacier must, of necessity, be provisional
because of the lack of mass balance and meteoro-
logical data, a situation which obtains throughout
Patagonia (Kadota et al. 1992). Nevertheless, it
seems apparent that the twentieth century oscilla-
tion history of the San Rafael Glacier correlates
imperfectly with twentieth century climate trends
in the region and with local trends of glacier be-
haviour.
The early part of the twentieth century saw a
general retreat of North Patagonian Icefield outlet
glaciers from mid-late nineteenth century
maximum positions. The eastern outlets experi-

enced earlier and more substantial retreats than
those on the west, and even by the 1950s most of
the western outlets had retreated little (Lliboutry
1956). Since 1944, retreat has been consistent and
almost universal (Aniya and Enomoto 1986;
Aniya 1988, 1992), although Lliboutry (1956:396)
noted that the San Quintin Glacier advanced at
some time between 1935 and 1950. The land-ter-
minating glaciers have typically been retreating at
mean rates of 40-80 m a', and between 1985 and
1990 there was a general acceleration of retreat
rates (Aniya 1992:59). The last two decades has
seen considerable thinning of the icefield accumu-
lation area, producing substantial vegetation trim-
lines, according to local pilots and Winchester (per-
sonal communication). Within this context of gen-
eral retreat, there has been considerable variation
of glacier behaviour, both in rates and timings.
Aniya and Enomoto (1986) provisionally ac-
counted for such contrasts in terms of local topo-
climatic and topographic effects.
The San Rafael Glacier has reflected this gross
regional trend, reaching a late-nineteenth century
maximum and retreating subsequently. It experi-
120
enced a mid-century readvance at the same time as
its southern neighbour, the San Quintin Glacier,
and has shared in the recent acceleration of retreat
rates. However, it has also diverged from the local
patterns in certain ways. While most of the west-
ern outlet glaciers remained near their Little Ice
Age maxima, the San Rafael Glacier retreated 8
km, losing almost 60 km2 of surface area and re-
ducing the length of its calving front from 18 km to
3 km. The strength and magnitude of the San
Rafael advance in the middle years of the century
was unparalleled, and at a time of accelerating re-
gional retreat, the stabilisation and slight read-
vance since 1990 is unique in the region.
Theoretical explanations
The behaviour of calving glaciers is controlled by
the interplay between climatic and glacio-dynamic
factors (Warren 1992). In seismically active areas,
earthquakes may also affect the stability of calving
fronts.
i) Climatic factors: Glaciers in a wet climate are

RAPID FLUCTUATIONS OF A CALVING GLACIER
held to be especially sensitive to temperature
changes (Oerlemans and Fortuin 1992), and yet
empirical evidence from Canada (Letr6guilly
1988), New Zealand (Brazier et al. 1992), Patago-
nia (Warren and Sugden, in press) and Alaska
(Trabant et al. 1991) suggests that in maritime
areas precipitation becomes the more important
term in the mass balance equation such that
glacier fluctuations correspond more closely to
precipitation than temperature. Furthermore,
calving glaciers appear to be less sensitive to temp-
erature than non-calving glaciers simply because
ablation at the latter is dominated by melting,
whereas high fractions of total ablation at calving
glaciers are achieved by calving (Glazovsky et al.
1991), and calving rates are controlled primarily by
topographic and sedimentological variables (Pow-
ell 1991). That precipitation is the more significant
climatic variable in controlling the behaviour of
temperate calving glaciers is also implied by the
Neoglacial and recent oscillations of calving
glaciers in Alaska (Wiles and Calkin, in press;
Wiles, personal communication) and West Green-
land (Warren 1991).
Modelling studies of the sensitivity of the Chi-
lean snowline to climate change (Caviedes 1990;
Kerr and Sugden, in press) have found that pre-
cipitation is a more important control than mean
annual temperature, reflecting changes in the at-
mospheric pressure system and ocean currents.
This means that small changes in the atmospheric
pressure systems over the Pacific can alter the
Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) by tens or even
hundreds of metres as a direct result of precipita-
tion variability (Kerr and Sugden, in press). The
ELA intersects the drainage basin of the San
Rafael Glacier in the low-gradient, icefield por-
tion, so that small changes in ELA will lead to sub-
stantial changes in the Accumulation Area Ratio
(AAR) and hence mass balance.
At San Rafael, very limited mass balance data
forbids an accurate estimation of the relative con-
tributions of melting and calving to total ablation,
but order of magnitude estimates by Kondo and
Yamada (1988) and Warren et al. (in prep.) both
suggest that the two processes contribute approxi-
mately equally to annual mass loss. If precipitation
is a more important climatic variable than temper-
ature, there will be a lag time before any climatic
signal finds expression at the glacier terminus, a
reaction time which, assuming kinematic wave
theory, will be a function of glacier length and ice
velocities. Given the very high ice velocities and
short distance from the equilibrium line to the ice
front (between 15 and 25 km at various times dur-
ing the last 100 years), the reaction time to precipi-
tation changes may be rather short, of the order of
5-10 years.
ii) Glacio-dynamic factors: The presence of calv-
ing introduces instability to the glacial system.
Thus, in addition to climatic factors, which largely
control ice supply to the terminus, glacier mass ba-
lance and hence ice front fluctuations are also con-
trolled by stability factors. Topography therefore
becomes especially important, primarily by con-
trolling calving rates through a strong dependence
on water depth (Brown et al. 1982; Pelto and War-
ren 1991), and also by defining places in the valley
system at which the inherently unstable calving
front can find an increased measure of stability.
Fjord narrowings and shallowings have long been
recognised as topographic pinning points at which
calving glaciers commonly halt (Mercer 1961). A
reduction of water depth reduces the calving
speed, and a reduction in width reduces the length
of the calving face, so both work to lessen the total
calving flux. Therefore, other things being equal,
calving fronts will tend to stabilise at such points.
These influences can overwhelm climatic forcing,
introducing the possibility of non-climatic oscilla-
tions (Alley 1991; Trabant et al. 1991). According
to Mann (1986), the sum of these influences means
that the situations in which calving glaciers are
most likely to respond anomalously to climate are
complex fjord systems, regions with low Equilib-
rium Line Altitudes, or where glaciers terminate
at the mouths of extensive fjord systems adjoining
the open sea.
Climatic sensitivity of the San Rafael Glacier
The steep climatic gradients, the absence of data
from the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen-
turies, the probability that the icefield is affected
by climatic changes that are not reflected at re-
mote meteorological stations (Fig. 10), and the ab-
sence of mass balance data place a caveat over any
attempt at unravelling the complex interplay be-
tween the highly variable climate and the dynamic
San Rafael Glacier.
However, the available data are suggestive of a
fluctuation history driven by precipitation and
modified by calving dynamics. None of the situa-
tions identified by Mann (1986) as being condu-
cive to anomalous behaviour obtain in the San

Rafael area. Unlike the deeply-incised and com-
plex topography of south-east Alaska, the Andes
in this area have a very sudden mountain front so
that the outlet glaciers flow steeply out of the
mountains onto an unrestricted coastal plain. Con-
sequently, the topographic context which appears
to be a necessary condition for large-scale asyn-
chronous fluctuations over centuries, namely, the
combination of low-gradient surface profiles and
long, narrow fjords, is absent here.
At San Rafael, advance leads to substantial in-
creases in ablation area and in the length of the
calving front, while retreat achieves the inverse.
There is therefore little possibility of large-scale
positive feedback. At its maximum a century ago,
the estimated Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR)
was 0.6, in contrast to the present AAR of 0.73.
The AAR range within which glaciers on land are
usually regarded as being in equilibrium with cli-
mate is 0.50-0.80 (Meier and Post 1962). How-
ever, calving glaciers can have AARs as high as
0.95 and they become progressively more vulnera-
ble to external influences, including climate
changes, once the AAR falls below 0.7 (Trabantet
al. 1991). Thus the retreat of the last hundred years
has taken the glacier across this stability threshold
from a vulnerable situation at the LIA maximum
to a condition closer to equilibrium.
At the maximum, furthermore, the 18 km ice
front was calving into mean water depths of about
80 m. Calving speed is proportional to the average
water depth at the ice front with a constant of prop-
ortionality of 27 a-' (Brown et al. 1982), so the calv-
ing speed (Vc) was probably 2200 m a-1. Ice vel-
ocities can be reconstructed using the continuity
equation Vc= V-X, where V is ice velocity and X is
the rate of change of the terminus position, posi-
tive in the direction of flow. For the stillstand to be
maintained, ice velocities must therefore also have
been 2200 m a-1.Assuming today's bathymetry and
ice cliff heights similar to today's, the annual calv-
ing flux was then approximately 5.1 km3. In other
words, even though ice velocities and calving
speeds were probably less than half those of today,
the calving flux was almost twice as great (Warren
et al. in prep.).
The topography is thus conducive to stability;
the runaway advances and retreats induced by to-
pographically-controlled positive feedback that
have been documented elsewhere are not possible
here. The theoretically expected pattern of be-
haviour is therefore a first order response to pre-
cipitation, with the irregularities superimposed by
122
topographic geometry determining both the loca-
tion and timing of stillstands and the magnitude
and rate of fluctuations.
The oscillations of the last hundred years can be
explained within this framework:
1880-1920: Retreat from the Little Ice Age
maximum was in phase with regional retreat, pre-
sumably triggered by increased melting and re-
duced ice supply. Because of its 'piedmont' form,
retreat rapidly reduced the length of the calving
front. During the 1910-1920 stillstand, calving
fluxes are estimated to have been 30% less than
those at the maximum, enabling the glacier to re-
store its equilibrium. In addition, it is of interest
that the precipitation record at Punta Arenas
(Aniya et al. 1992), which shares the notable mid-
century and recent peaks of Fig. 10, shows high
rainfall totals in the early part of the century. It
seems reasonable to infer from this, and from the
fact that the Cabo Raper record starts at a high
level, that the early-century stillstand was also
partly a response to high precipitation.
1920-1935: Continued reduction of ice supply, in-
dicated by continued regional retreat, albeit slow,
forced further recession. At this position in the
Laguna San Rafael, retreat took the ice front into
steadily deepening water. Calving rates rose
rapidly, the front became progressively more un-
stable, and the dramatic 400 m a'1 retreat ensued,
taking the front back to the topographic pinning
point of the valley mouth. At this point, the width-
averaged water depth is 140 m, so calving rates
probably rose to around 3800 m a-1. However,
these high rates were only occurring along a front
probably 3 km long, so that total calving fluxes
would have been of the order of 2.2 km3 a 1, a
further 40% reduction from those at the time of
the previous stillstand. Moreover, the ablation
area at this time, an estimated 185 km2, was 50 km2
(= 21%) less than that at its reconstructed LIA
maximum, further reducing total ablation.
1935-1959: The mid-century readvance can be
most easily explained by a rapid response to the
dramatic rise in winter precipitation during the
1930s and 1940s (Table 1), amplified by the fact
that the advance took the front forward into shal-
lowing water.
1960-1970: In the 1960s, winter precipitation fell
to levels half those of the mean for the previous

RAPID FLUCTUATIONS OF A CALVING GLACIER
three decades. This in itself may explain the com-
mencement of retreat. However, it is of interest
that the huge earthquake of 1960 also coincides
with the beginning of this retreat which was a sud-
den reversal in trend from the strong advance that
was in progress in 1959 (Heusser 1960). Severe
earthquakes are thought to have initiated cata-
strophic break-up and retreat of calving termini in
Alaska (Gilbert 1904; Tarr and Martin 1912),
either directly, through fracturing of the ice ton-
gue, or indirectly through the initiation of sedi-
ment slumping in the immediate proglacial area,
increasing the effective water depth (cf. Powell
1988). The 1960 earthquake may have triggered
the retreat of the last three decades, but a causal
link cannot be established on the basis of this tem-
poral coincidence alone.
1970-1990: The accelerating retreat of the last two
decades has taken place during the wettest de-
cades of the century which at first sight under-
mines the supposed precipitation linkage. How-
ever, the glacier has been retreating in the greatest
water depths in the Laguna, so that, despite the re-
latively short length of the ice front, calving fluxes
have probably been consistently in excess of 2.4
km3 a-'. The instabilities and rapid calving caused
by the increasing water depths have overwhelmed
the influence of high precipitation.
1990-1992: The explanation of the recent cessa-
tion of retreat at a time of accelerating regional re-
treat and icefield shrinkage is not straightforward
because the majority of the glacier terminus is calv-
ing into deep water, a situation which should prom-
ote continued rapid retreat. However, the geo-
metry of the rock channel, combined with the con-
sistently high precipitation, may largely explain
the halt. The present location of the ice front is a
topographic pinning point at which the valley
width is 19% less than the channel section up
which the glacier has recently retreated. At the
south side, there has been a marked shallowing.
The width-averaged depth near the ice front is 7%
less than that in the middle part of the channel,
and calving losses are substantially lower along the
south quarter of the ice front than from the rest of
the calving cliff.
These contrasts are not great but may have been
just enough to enable the ice front to cross a stabil-
ity threshold. The current stability may therefore
be a delayed response to the recent high precipita-
tion. This may explain the stabilisation of the
front, but it may also be that water depths shallow
towards the calving front. Soundings immediately
in front of the calving cliff itself were prevented by
prudence, but water depths may decrease towards
the front. The large southern valleyside spur
suggests this, as does the steepness and shortness
of the confined valley section of the glacier.
Conclusions
After three decades of rapid retreat, the San
Rafael Glacier has now stabilised and parts of the
front have begun to advance at a time when almost
all other glaciers in the region are in accelerating
recession. While the interaction of calving dyna-
mics with the topographic geometry of the Laguna
San Rafael has clearly distorted the climatic sig-
nal, amplifying, damping and delaying it at diffe-
rent times, the twentieth century behaviour of the
glacier appears to be controlled primarily by varia-
tions in winter precipitation. Stillstands or ad-
vances have followed the three wettest periods of
the century. Consequently, on annual to decadal
timescales, up to about three decades, oscillations
of the San Rafael Glacier may not be directly re-
lated to climate change, but at all longer time-
scales it is probable that the fluctuations may be
used as a proxy climate record that primarily re-
flects precipitation variations. Temperature varia-
tions do not appear to have exerted any significant
control on the recent history of advance and re-
treat. These results reinforce several recent
studies, both empirical and numerical, that have
emphasised the importance of topography in mod-
ulating the response of glaciers, and particularly
calving glaciers, to climate change through the in-
troduction of stability thresholds (Payne and Sug-
den 1990; Warren 1991). It should be stressed,
though, that any conclusions about the relation-
ship between glacier behaviour and climate
change in Patagonia must be provisional because
of the lack of mass balance and meteorological
data.
