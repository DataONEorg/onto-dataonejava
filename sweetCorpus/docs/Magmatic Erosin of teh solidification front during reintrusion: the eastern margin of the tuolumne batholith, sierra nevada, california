Abstract The Tuolumne batholith, Sierra Nevada,
California, consists of several nested granitoid units and is
an example of upper-crustal normally zoned intrusions.
The two outermost units of the batholith are separated by a
wide gradational contact in what is interpreted to represent
a large magma chamber. In the Potter Point area near the
eastern margin of the batholith, the gradational contact is
cross-cut by a network of interconnected mafic–felsic
sheets, which grade into zones of magmatic erosion by
stoping where the host granodiorite between the sheets was
entirely removed and replaced by younger enclave-rich
quartz diorite. We interpret these features to record dis-
ruption of a steep solidification front, which migrated
inwards from the eastern batholith margin and separated
the mushy to solidified margin from the remaining active
magma chamber. When intersecting the gradational con-
tact, the solidification front started to break up via a
network of tectonically driven fractures accompanied by
simultaneous injection of localized magma pulses. The
solidification front break-up is interpreted here as an initial
stage of a ‘‘recycling’’ process, whereby older magma
mush is disrupted and incorporated into younger magma

Introduction
Physical and chemical interactions of contrasted magma
pulses have long been recognized as a common process in
magma chambers in all tectonic settings. In this regard,
most studies concentrated on various aspects of mafic–felsic
interactions in granitoid magma chambers replenished
by episodic mafic inputs (e.g., Fernandez and Gasquet
1994; Frost and Mahood 1987; Neves and Vauchez 1995;
Fernandez et al. 1997; Perugini and Poli 2005; Slaby and
Martin 2008; Wada et al. 2004; Wiebe 1994; Wiebe et al.
2002).
In this paper, we examine in detail a single spectacular
outcrop referred to as the ‘‘Potter Point area’’ in the eastern
part of the Tuolumne batholith, Sierra Nevada, California;
this locality represents a unique setting to study interac-
tions between the resident magma mush, magma mingling
and enclave formation, and small-scale magma injections
intruding along an internal contact within an upper-crustal
granitoid magma chamber. Most importantly, this outcrop
provides some clues on the mechanisms and driving forces
of intrachamber magmatic erosion by stoping, that is, how
older (resident) intrusive units are initially disrupted before
being ‘‘recycled’’ into new magma batches.
As the geological framework of our study has been
ˇ ́
described several times elsewhere (Bateman 1992; Zak and
Paterson 2005), below we only briefly outline the geology
123
802
of the Tuolumne batholith with a particular reference to its
eastern margin. We then describe in detail field observa-
tions and results of detailed mapping in the Potter Point
area. Finally, we use these data as a background for
interpreting the significance of the magma-interaction
structures preserved in this domain and for a more general
discussion of magma-interaction processes along internal
contacts in granitoid magma chambers.
Geological setting
A brief overview of the geology of the Tuolumne
batholith
The Late Cretaceous (*95–85 Ma; Coleman et al. 2004;
Miller et al. 2007; Matzel et al. 2007a, b; Bracciali et al.
2008) Tuolumne batholith exposed in the central Sierra
Nevada, CA (Fig. 1) is one of the classical examples of
large, normally zoned Cordilleran intrusions. The host
rock into which the batholith was emplaced comprises (1)
early Cretaceous granitoids and metasedimentary rocks to
the south and west and (2) early Paleozoic to Cretaceous
greenschist to amphibolite facies metasedimentary and
metavolcanic rocks (the Eastern Sierra pendants) with
Triassic to Cretaceous plutons to the east and north. The

estimates of emplacement depth of the Tuolumne batho-
lith based on Al-in hornblende barometry (Ague and
Brimhall 1988; Webber et al. 2001; Anderson et al. 2007)
indicate a presently exposed depth of emplacement of
*7–9 km.
The batholith consists of the following concentrically
arranged and progressively inwards more felsic units,
representing several separate magma pulses (Fig. 1;
Bateman 1992; Bateman and Chappell 1979): (1) The
outermost Kuna Crest unit (KKC) comprises mostly fine-
to-medium grained, dark colored, equigranular tonalite,
quartz diorite, to biotite–hornblende granodiorite, typically
with a strong magmatic foliation and abundant mafic
enclave swarms. (2) The Half Dome unit (KHD), consisting
of an outer equigranular and inner porphyritic granodiorite,
is generally much coarser grained than the KKC and is
characterized by the presence of large (up to *2 cm in
length) prismatic euhedral hornblendes and conspicuous
sphene. The porphyric variety contains large (up to *3 cm
in length) K-feldspar phenocrysts. (3) The K-feldspar
megacrystic Cathedral Peak granodiorite unit (KCP) forms
the most voluminous part of the Tuolumne batholith and
typically consists of biotite granodiorite containing abun-
dant large K-feldspar phenocrysts (in average 4–5 cm, but
locally up to *12 cm in length) in a medium grained
matrix. (4) The innermost Johnson granite porphyry (KJP)
Int J Earth Sci (Geol Rundsch) (2010) 99:801–812
is fine-grained equigranular granite, locally containing
sparse K-feldspar phenocrysts and miarolitic cavities.
The more detailed information on rock composition and
geochemistry can be found in Bateman and Chappell
(1979), Kistler et al. (1986), and Gray et al. (2008).
The eastern margin of the batholith
Along its eastern margin, the batholith intrudes into Lower
Paleozoic metasedimentary units unconformably overlain
by Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic volcano-sedimentary
sequences (Fig. 1; the Saddlebag Lake and Northern Ritter
Range roof pendants; Albertz 2006; Brook 1977; Greene
and Schweickert 1995; Stevens and Greene 1999) all of
which experienced polyphase deformational history. On a
1:100,000 map scale, the batholith/host rock contact is a
relatively simple, steep intrusive boundary striking 330°.
The internal contacts between the three main intrusive
units exposed in the eastern part of the batholith vary from
gradational (the Kuna Crest/Half Dome contact) to sharp
(the Half Dome/Cathedral Peak contact) and are described
ˇ ́
in detail in our previous work (Zak and Paterson 2005).
Here we focus only on describing the contact between the
Kuna Crest and outer (equigranular) Half Dome units,
which is directly relevant to the present study.
The Kuna Crest unit/Half Dome contact is the most
variable and locally complex intrusive boundary in the
batholith. In map view, the contact is highly irregular
(Figs. 1, 2b). In the southern part of the area, the contact
generally strikes *NE–SW. At Potter Point, the contact
steps to the southeast, takes a large, curved bend and then
irregularly continues to the north, where it is truncated by
803
the Cathedral Peak granodiorite. Contact relationships vary
along its strike: the contact is sharp, sheeted, or complex
with multiple magma injection, stoping and mingling
involved (e.g., see the following sections on Potter Point)
but in most places it is gradational over a several hundred
ˇ ́
meter wide zone (Fig. 2b; see Zak and Paterson 2005 for
details). The gradation is manifested in the field as a modal
decrease in mafic minerals, modal increase in euhedral
hornblendes (up to 0.5–1 cm in size), and a decreasing
amount of sphene in an inward direction from the Kuna
Crest to Half Dome granodiorite. Both granodiorites thus
continuously pass into each other with no sharp boundaries
on either side.
Magmatic interactions in the Potter Point area
One of the superbly exposed domains of complex magma
interactions we have discovered in the Tuolumne batholith
ˇ ́
(Zak and Paterson 2005) is a flat, glacier-polished
*150 9 220 m outcrop located on right-hand bank of the
Lyell Fork (tributary of the Tuolumne River), *1 km east
of Potter Point in Lyell Canyon (Fig. 2a, b). This domain
occurs at the tip of a lobe of the equigranular Half Dome
granodiorite extending southeastward from the main bath-
olith into the Kuna Crest granodiorite, within the wide
gradational contact between the two units (Fig. 2a). The
main rock type within this gradational contact, and thus
also in the Potter Point area, has characteristics transitional
between the Kuna Crest tonalite/granodiorite and equi-
granular Half Dome granodiorite and is hereinafter referred
to as the ‘‘transitional’’ Kuna Crest granodiorite.

The Kuna Crest granodiorite autoliths
In the eastern part of the outcrop, that is closer to the outer
batholith margin, two isolated large blocks (tens of meters
in size) of the Kuna Crest granodiorite were found entirely
engulfed within the ‘‘transitional’’ Kuna Crest granodiorite.
The blocks of the Kuna Crest granodiorite are characterized
by abundant mafic microgranular enclaves set in granodi-
orite to tonalite (Fig. 3). The enclaves are aligned parallel
to strong magmatic foliation in their host granodiorite. The
outer margins of the blocks and their contacts against the
host granodiorite are irregular, in places diffuse but in some
places also sharp, fracture-like, truncating structures
(mineral fabric, enclaves) inside the blocks. The blocks are
similar to the Kuna Crest granodiorite that typically occurs
along the eastern margin of the batholith adjacent to the
host rock, suggesting that they may represent autoliths, i.e.,
remnants of marginal parts of the batholith that have been
stoped and incorporated into younger pulses.

contemporaneous injection of both sets. Kinematics
observed in a horizontal surface and determined by offsets
of older structures along sheet margins is predominantly
right-lateral for the *NW–SE mafic sheets, whereas the
*NE–SW felsic sheets are mostly extensional (dilational)
with no significant shear displacement along sheet mar-
gins. Average spacing (the shortest distance measured in
direction perpendicular to sheet margins) of the sheets is
*20–30 m. The individual sheets are typically 1–2 m
thick, tens of meters long, and have knife-sharp and
straight boundaries (Fig. 4a, b). Commonly, the sheets are
internally layered with alternating mafic–felsic layers or
have more mafic interior and felsic rim along sheet margins
and vice versa (Fig. 4c, d). The mafic–felsic interface is
sharp and straight, but in many cases is complex with
lobate geometry, bulges of one magma into another, or the
felsic margin is fragmented into centimeter-sized blocks
enclosed in the mafic interior sheet (Fig. 4c, d).
Enclave swarms, schlieren tubes, and ladder dikes
Magmatic sheets
Throughout the study area, the ‘‘transitional’’ Kuna Crest
granodiorite has been intruded by numerous mafic
(cumulates rich in hornblende and biotite), felsic (aplitic,
aplopegmatitic, and trondhjemitic composition), and com-
posite mafic–felsic sheets. The sheets dip steeply and in
general form two sets distinguished on the basis of their
orientation and cross-cutting relationships (Figs. 2b, 4a):
an older *NW–SE predominantly mafic or mafic–felsic
set and a younger *NNE–SSW to *NE–SW predomi-
nantly felsic set. However, in several cases reverse cross-
cutting relationships were observed indicating nearly

tional’’ Kuna Crest granodiorite

The Potter Point area is unusual in exposing a variety of
small-scale magmatic structures hosted in the otherwise
superficially homogeneous granodiorite. (1) Microgranular
enclaves occur scattered throughout the outcrop, but are
particularly concentrated in close association with the
sheets to form variously shaped enclave accumulations
(Fig. 5a, b). The most remarkable examples are closely
packed enclave accumulations bounded by sharp margins
against the host granodiorite (Fig. 5c) and commonly also
mingled with cumulates rich in hornblende and biotite
(Fig. 5d). These accumulations tend to be elongated in plan-
view and statistically oriented *NW–SE (Fig. 5c, d). The
long axes of individual enclaves inside the accumulations
are in many cases also oriented *NW–SE. In Fig. 5c, the
enclaves form a bulge extending outward from a sheet-like
accumulation, the long axes of enclaves within the sheet are
at a high angle to the outer-sheet contact. (2) Meter-scale
bulges or protrusions extend sideways (in plan-view) from
otherwise straight mafic–felsic sheet margins (Fig. 6a).
These bulges may deform layering and enclave accumula-
tions in the host granodiorite (Fig. 6a) and in some cases are
also elongated in the *NW–SE direction. (3) In the
southeastern part of the Potter Point outcrop, the host
granodiorite is cross-cut by several ladder dikes (Fig. 6b;
migrating tubes, using terminology of Weinberg et al.
2001). These ladder dikes consist of multiple, sequentially
emplaced tube-shaped bodies of more mafic biotite- and
hornblende-rich cumulate, with individual tubes delineated
by mafic schlieren. Cross-cutting relationships between
individual tubes indicate the origin and direction of youn-
ging (propagation) of the ladder dikes. In Fig. 6b, 15 m
long ladder dike propagated from its origin first to the

Zones of host granodiorite break-up
Aside from the above described sheets intruding the
‘‘transitional’’ Kuna Crest granodiorite (in ‘‘Enclave
swarms, schlieren tubes, and ladder dikes’’), some wider
zones in the western half of the outcrop show evidence of
break-up of the host ‘‘transitional’’ Kuna Crest granodiorite
into separate blocks. In this study, we examined the best
exposed of these zones in detail. A detailed map of this
zone was constructed using a rectangular 9 9 7 m grid set
up on the flat glaciated surface. Photographs were taken of

magmatic fractures. Some segments have more irregular to

surrounded by compositionally very heterogeneous intrusive
material, typically more mafic than the host granodiorite and
containing abundant microgranular enclaves or larger
irregular blobs of granodiorite to quartz diorite (Figs. 7, 8). A
few ‘‘exotic’’ blocks in the zone are composed of leucocratic
granite to trondhjemite (Figs. 7, 8). The enclaves between
the blocks are commonly densely packed or molded around

veins. These leucocratic veins are very fine-grained and
have diffuse margins against the host granodiorite. Their
tips are also diffuse, the veins are gradually narrowing
and the felsic infill dissipates in the host granodiorite.
Most of the observed cracks are, however, filled by quartz
diorite to form sheets that are thicker (*10–20 cm) than
the leucocratic veins. These sheets have sharp margins
against the host granodiorite. In map-view the mafic
sheets are straight, although a few have been folded into
open magmatic folds. A few thin leucocratic veins that
cross-cut the mafic quartz dioritic sheets also have been
folded into close magmatic folds.
Magmatic fabrics

quartz diorite; details of the zone shown in Fig. 7
the block margins. This heterogeneous intrusive material
is clearly younger than the ‘‘transitional’’ Kuna Crest
granodiorite, contains large euhedral hornblendes typical
of the Half Dome granodiorite, and microgranular
enclaves that are also similar to those found in the Half
Dome granodiorite. These field criteria (no geochemical
data have been published as yet) suggest that the inter-
vening intrusive rocks may represent enclave-rich
magma derived from the Half Dome unit. The block
sizes vary from several decimeters up to *3–5 m. In the
map (Fig. 7), the blocks have triangular or rectangular
shapes with blunt corners or in some cases are rather
irregular. Their margins are typically sharp and straight,
locally lobate or diffuse. Some structures such as
deformed layering, molded enclaves, and sheets around
the blocks indicate that the blocks have been rotated and/
or displaced relative to each other in the horizontal
section.
A variety of minor structures preserved in and around
this zone provides further hints concerning the mecha-
nisms of break-up of the host granodiorite (see also
Paterson et al. 2007). In some places, thin (*0.5–1 cm)
sub-magmatic cracks in the host granodiorite and inside
some blocks were intruded by leucocratic melts forming
Magmatic fabric, i.e., foliation and lineation defined by
mineral grains with no signs of subsolidus deformation
(Paterson et al. 1989, 1998; Vernon 2000), provides
evidence for the presence of a melt during fabric for-
mation. In the Potter Point area, the horizontal glacier-
polished outcrop prevents detailed examination of the
mineral lineation, which plunges steeply to vertically in
ˇ ́
much of the batholith (Zak et al. 2007); we thus describe
only magmatic (mineral) foliation in the following
section.
Two distinct types of magmatic foliation were recog-
nized in the Potter Point area. (1) Local magmatic foliation
which is restricted to mafic schlieren, interior of the sheets,
enclaves, or local instabilities described above. This foli-
ation has no consistent orientation across the outcrop and
typically mimicks the geometry of the small-scale struc-
ˇ ́
tures in which it is contained (Type 1 of Zak et al. 2007).
The foliation is typically parallel to the sheet margins, to
the base of schlieren, or exhibits parabolic pattern within
planar sheets (Fig. 9a).
(2) The dominant mineral magmatic foliation in the
Potter Point area is subvertical and strikes *NW–SE
ˇ ́
(Fig. 9b–d). This foliation, referred to as Type 4 by Zak
et al. (2007), is continuous across internal contacts between
intrusive units (Fig. 2a), is widespread in the batholith, and
corresponds to late *NW–SE crenulations in the host rock
ˇ ́
(Economos et al. 2005; Zak et al. 2007). In the Potter Point
outcrop, this foliation is axial planar to magmatically fol-
ˇ ́
ded aplite dikes (Fig. 6d in Zak et al. 2007) and overprints
all the above described features such as sheets, enclave
accumulations, and zones with abundant blocks. The
overprinting relationships are observed both at the map-
scale (Figs. 2b, 7) and at the grain-scale. In the latter case,
the foliation runs across the sheet or block margins with no
change in orientation (Fig. 9b, c). In the most complex
zone, the foliation retains the same orientation in the
granodiorite blocks and in their mingled enclave-rich host
(Fig. 7).

Discussion
Interpretation of an overall succession of intrusive
events
At a larger scale, the magmatic history of the eastern
margin of the batholith commenced with the emplacement
of the outermost Kuna Crest and the inner equigranular
Half Dome units. The existing radiometric ages indicate a
short time span between their crystallization in this part of
the batholith (Coleman et al. 2004; Matzel et al. 2007a, b;
Miller et al. 2007). Contrary to the interpretation of
Glazner et al. (2002) that the outer units of the Tuolumne
batholith were emplaced incrementally as a dike swarm,
we found no field evidence, such as abundant internal
contacts or compositional and textural variations, for vol-
umetrically significant diking, even near the contact with
the host rock where the dikes should be preserved owing to
rapid freezing (see Vernon and Paterson 2008 for detailed
discussion of the issue). Instead, our detailed mapping of
ˇ ́
much of the eastern batholith margin (Zak and Paterson
ˇ ak et al. 2007; this study) revealed that both the
2005; Z  ́
Kuna Crest and Half Dome units are texturally homoge-
neous over broad scales or show gradational changes in the
lobes extending outward from the main batholith (Memeti
et al. 2005). The sole exceptions are thin sheets of the Kuna
Crest granodiorite preserved in the narrow (tens of meters)
aureole, and a few locally complex sheeted zones described
in our previous work interpreted to have formed within the
123
ˇ ́
existing batholith (Zak and Paterson 2005; Paterson et al.
2008).
The large-scale homogeneity of the granitoids favors an
interpretation that, at the eastern batholith margin, the Kuna
Crest and Half Dome units intruded broadly synchronously as
fairly large magma batches, which magmatically interacted
along the Kuna Crest/Half Dome granodiorite contact. This
lead to the development of the hundreds of meters wide
gradational contact between the two units (Fig. 2a) and to
stoping of the partially solidified carapace (e.g., Fig. 3).
Subsequently, localized pulses of enclave-rich mafic
cumulates and more fractionated felsic magmas intruded
within the wide gradational zone. The features resulting
from this process are superbly exposed in the Potter Point
area, providing a unique window into small-scale processes
that operate along a chamber-scale internal contact
between the neighboring magma batches.
Field constraints on host magma rheology
during reintrusion
The following field observations suggest that in the Potter
Point area the ‘‘transitional’’ Kuna Crest granodiorite was a
melt-bearing crystal-rich mush when it was intruded by the
mingled magmas. At least two distinct types of rheological
behavior of the host magma can be recognized.
(1)
During formation of the small-scale thermal–mechan-
ical instabilities, such as ladder dikes (Fig. 6b) or
Int J Earth Sci (Geol Rundsch) (2010) 99:801–812
(2)
enclave accumulation and mafic magma protrusions
(Figs. 5, 6a), the host granodiorite was capable of
continuously deforming and flowing around these
structures; the deflected layering shown in Fig. 6a is a
particularly illustrative example. Sharp margins of
these structures (Fig. 6) indicate that the interfaces
were resistant to gravitational wall-collapses (sensu
Bergantz 2000) and were capable of sustaining drag
effects of flowing magma. In addition, these struc-
tures also tend to be statistically elongated in the
*NW–SE direction in plan-view, that is, parallel to
the widespread magmatic foliation (e.g., Figs. 5c, 6b).
No synmagmatic fracturing occurred at this stage.
Taken together, we infer that these structures formed
within a host crystal-rich mush having Bingham-type
rheology between the first (Th1) and second (Th2)
rheological thresholds of Fernandez and Gasquet
(1994).
The second type of behavior is characterized by the
injection of multiple mafic–felsic sheets into a
network consisting of interconnected *NE–SW and
*NW–SE fractures. This process resulted in the
disintegration of the host granodiorite into large (tens
of meters) fracture-bounded blocks. The fracture or
block margins, mafic schlieren, and enclave accumu-
lations were overprinted at the grain-scale by the
batholith-wide magmatic (mineral) *NW–SE folia-
tion (Fig. 9b, c) suggesting that the fractures
propagated through the melt-bearing (not fully crys-
tallized) crystal mushes. In the most complex zones of
the host granodiorite break-up, the mingled enclave-
rich interstitial magma and the host blocks also
acquired the same mineral foliation (Fig. 7) preserv-
ing evidence for the presence of at least a small melt
fraction in the host granodiorite during and after crack
propagation and stoping. The morphology of the
fractures having knife-sharp, tens of meters long but
straight margins implies quasi-solid-state behavior
well above the second rheological threshold of the
host (*70–90% of solid crystals?).

steep wall (the eastern margin of the batholith), rather than
as repeated cooling–reheating events of the entire chamber
caused by amalgamation of numerous discrete magma
injections.
If the above inferences are true, the Potter Point area
preserves a record of magma pulsing into and incipient
stoping, mingling, and erosion of a migrating, chamber-
scale solidification front. In our view, compositionally
heterogeneous, but predominantly quartz dioritic, mingled
magmas intruded along the gradational Kuna Crest/Half
Dome contact, intersected the inward migrating solidifi-
cation front, and may have caused very local reheating. The
rheological inferences made above suggest that this inter-
action took place in the fairly rigid mush zone along the
solidification front (using terminology of Marsh 1995),
where the intruding magmas started to break off pieces of
the solidification front along a network of synmagmatic
fractures.
The causes of solidification front disruption and the
nature of driving forces necessary for propagation of these
fractures may be further understood by examining the
geometric relationship between magmatic fabric and the
two sets of sheets. As noted above, the predominantly
mafic or composite mafic–felsic *NW–SE sheets com-
monly exhibit a component of dextral displacement (hybrid
fractures), whereas the felsic *NE–SW sheets are purely
extensional (Mode I, opening perpendicular to sheet mar-
gins). In Fig. 10, average orientations of the sheets and
magmatic foliation are represented by eigenvectors V1 of
their poles. Assuming that the pole to magmatic foliation
tends to be parallel to the local principal shortening
direction (Paterson et al. 1998), the solidification front in
Implications for processes along internal contacts
in magma chambers
Assuming that the Kuna Crest and Half Dome granodior-
ites were juxtaposed to form a large magma chamber, their
emplacement at around 92 Ma and mixing along the wide
Kuna Crest/Half Dome granodiorite gradational boundary
must have been followed by thermal decay and inward
migration of a solidification front (Marsh 1989, 1995). In
this part of the Tuolumne magma chamber, we view this
process as relatively simple, monotonic cooling from the

the Potter Point area experienced *NNE–SSW shortening
during magmatic fabric formation. This inferred principal
shortening is (a) oblique to the mafic–felsic sheets, and thus
may explain the dextral displacement during *NW–SE
fracture propagation (Fig. 10), and (b) is also parallel to the
orientation of felsic sheets, which is consistent with the
extensional (opening-mode) type of these fractures with no
shear displacement in horizontal plane (Fig. 10).
The regional *NW–SE magmatic foliation was inter-
preted as a result of regional tectonic strain superimposed
on the Tuolumne batholith prior its full crystallization
ˇ ́
(Type 4 fabric of Zak et al. 2007). Taken together, we
propose that the break-up of the solidification front was
facilitated by differential stress transmitted across the Tu-
olumne magma chamber in response to regional tectonic
forces at around 92 Ma. This interpretation is further sup-
ported by the alignment of ladder dikes, enclave swarms,
and layered protrusions parallel to the regional magmatic
foliation (e.g., Figs. 5c, 6b), suggesting that the host
granodiorite mush had already been under the differential
stress during formation of these structures. The stress field
of the same orientation was maintained after cracking as
documented by the *NW–SE magmatic foliation over-
printing fracture (sheet) margins.
In summary, we proposed elsewhere that stoping and
‘‘reworking’’ resulting in recycling of older resident
magma by younger intruding magma batches was a com-
mon process along the main internal contacts in the
ˇ ́
Tuolumne magma chamber (Zak and Paterson 2005;
Paterson et al. 2008). Structures in the Potter Point area
represent ‘‘frozen-in’’, initial to advanced stages of this
internal stoping which occured through the propagation of
orthogonal sets of synmagmatic fractures. Similar sets of
fractures, such as those described in this paper, were doc-
umented in other domains along the eastern margin of the
batholith (the Sawmill Canyon and Mammoth Peak areas;
ˇ ́
Zak and Paterson 2005; Paterson et al. 2008) and were also
interpreted to assist stoping and ‘‘recycling’’ of magma
mush along internal contacts in the magma chamber
(Paterson et al. 2008). The solidification front break-up
then leads to the complete removal of resident magma and
results in the truncation of intrusive units along discordant
ˇ ́
internal contacts (e.g., Zak and Paterson 2005).
Conclusions
(1)
The Kuna Crest and the equigranular Half Dome units
were emplaced broadly synchronously resulting in a
large magma chamber as evidenced by a 100 s meters
wide gradational contact between the two units and
their remarkable textural and compositional homo-
geneity over broad scales. Subsequent cooling from
123
the eastern margin of the batholith resulted in an
inward migration of a steep solidification front, sep-
arating the mushy to solidified margin from the
remaining active magma chamber.

(4)
When intersecting the wide gradational internal
contact between the Kuna Crest and the Half Dome
units, the melt-bearing mush to rigid crust zone of the
solidification front started to break up via a network
of interconnected *NW–SE hybrid and *NE–SW
extensional fractures accompanied by simultaneous
injection of localized mafic–felsic magma pulses.
We suggest that the break-up of the solidification
front was controlled by differential stress transmitted
across the Tuolumne magma chamber in response to
regional tectonic forces at around 93–89 Ma. This
interpretation is supported by the alignment of ladder
dikes, enclave swarms, and layered protrusions par-
allel to the regional *NW–SE magmatic foliation,
suggesting that the host granodiorite mush had
already been under the differential stress during
formation of these structures, and by the magmatic
foliation overprinting fracture margins.
The above described solidification front break-up is
interpreted as an initial stage of a ‘‘recycling’’ process,
whereby older resident magma mush is disrupted and
incorporated into younger magma batches. Based on
our field observation from other areas along the eastern
margin of the batholith, we propose that magma mush
stoping and ‘‘recycling’’ was a widespread process
along the main internal contacts in the Tuolumne
magma chamber.
