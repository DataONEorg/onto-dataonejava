the leaf sample included the total amount of leaf tissue on an
individual plant. The tissue was oven-dried (70Â°C) in the field
and returned to the laboratory for chemcial analysis. Samples of
the immature soil from mudboils were stored in plastic bagsand

Sampling of till and Vciccir~irtrn
rtligirrosrrrn was conducted on
a grid positioned to include the area of U-Cu-Pb mineralization
and its associated glacial dispersal train (DiLabio 1979). The grid
consisted of a base line (approximately 1 km) parallel to the
ice-flow directions and traverses at 100-m intervals oriented
perpendicular to ice flow.
Till samples were gathered from mudboils along each
traverse. Samples weighing approximatley 2 kg were collected
from the centres of mudboils at the bottom of pits (30-60cm in
depth) dug into the disturbed till. Organic inclusions and till with
iron or manganese oxide straining were avoided, but a few
samples (<5%) were unavoidably collected from such material.
Till from mudboils was chosen as the primary sampling
medium because: (i) till is the "first derivative" of bedrock,
The results of the uraniumanalyses ofthe clay-size
fraction of till samples from the grid are shown in
Fig. 2b. Background uranium levels in this region
are less than 2 ppm (Klassen and Shilts 1977). The
highest uranium levels (4-152 ppm) are above
mineralized zones and in zones adjacent to
mineralization in the direction of glacial flow
(down-ice). Samples in the down-ice part of thegrid
define the tail of a narrow dispersal train (1500 m
long and 100 m wide), aligned parallel to the direc-
tion of glacial movement.
The levels of copper (Fig. 2c) and lead (not
shown), although not as enriched as uranium, are

elevated at sites overlying mineralization and im-
mediately down-ice from mineralization. Most of
the copper values in the grid are less than 20 ppm,
and some are less than 10 ppm, which compare with
the known background copper level of less than
20 ppm (Klassen and Shilts 1977). Lead values
range from 20 to 30 ppm.
Figure 3 illustrates the level of uranium, copper,
and lead in leaf tissue of V. uliginosum. There are
broad ranges in the concentrations: uranium
0.4-980 ppm in ash, copper 4.5-3973 ppm, and lead
0.1-3964 ppm, with most concentrations clustered
close to background level. Compared with results
for other arctic species the background values are
similar; however, the maximal values in this study
are considerably higher (Doyle et a l . 1973; Jones et
a l . 1976; Rencz 1979). The higher values are a
product of the high concentrations in the soil and
the known ability of V. uliginosum to accumulate
heavy metals (Rencz 1979).
The dispersal train, as detected by elemental
levels in V. ~rligitzosum(Fig. 4), mimics the pattern
found in till samples (Fig. 2). Both maps illustrate
anomalous levels of U and Cu at sites above or
immediately down-ice of mineralization. The ab-
sence of anomalous levels at distances greater than
1500 m from the source suggests that only a small
volume of rocks was eroded.
The small dispersal train and corresponding dis-
continuous range of metals in the soil do not pro-
vide adequate information to study soil-plant lead
relations. The data for relationships of copper and
uranium in soil and plant material represent a more
complete range of metal values (Fig. 3). V[~cciniutn
lrliginosirtn grows on soil over a broad range of
copper and uranium values, and over this range
plant accumulation is linearly related to soil levels
of copper and uranium. The high correlations of
0.98 for uranium and 0.78 for copper in plant versus
soil material (Fig. 3) illustrate that V. ~rliginos~r~n
will reflect anomalous levels of metals in the soil.
The high tissue concentrations, which are con-
siderabl y above physiologicall y acceptable levels
(Bowen 1966), suggest that V. lrliginosirtn is toler-
ant of heavy metals. The tolerance is not specific to
one element, as abnormal levels of uranium, cop-
per, and lead were found. Rencz (1979) has also
shown that V. uligitzos~rtnwill accumulate anoma-
lous levels of zinc and nickel where the soil is rich in
those elements.
In our experimental design we were unable to
assess variations among individuals growing in soil
of identical element composition. There was no
detectable variation in accumulation among indi-
viduals on sites where metal levels were relatively

low (Fig. 3), however phenotypic variation at
higher concentrations should be examined.
The accumulation of copper by V. uligirzos~lrn
at
Kazan River differs from the species' response to
anomalous copper at Ferguson Lake (Rencz 1979).
The population at Ferguson Lake, unlike that at
Kazan River, has a threshold in copper accumula-
tion and has lower maximal levels of copper ac-
cumulation. The lower accumulation in plants at
Ferguson Lake occurred despite higher levels of
metals in the soil and lower pH values which typi-
cally increase the availability of heavy metals
(Khalid et N I . 1977). We consider the differences in
plant uptake to be a product of variations in the
nature and type of mineralization at each site. Fer-
guson Lake is dominated by massive sulphide
mineralization and associated gossans (highly acid,
iron-rich residual soils developed by postglacial
weathering of rock rich in sulfide minerals); con-
sequent1y, copper-rich soils, where copper ac-
cumulation should be highest, are associated with
low pH (<3.2), high sulfate, iron, and nickel levels
(Rencz 1979), an environment extremely toxic to
plants. In comparison, elevated copper levels in the
soil at Kazan River are associated with pH values
>5.9, and average Ca concentrations of 120ppm
(0.01 N HCI extraction on <2.00 mm soil fraction)
are two to three times greater than levels at Fergu-
son Lake. As these factors will mitigate the toxic
effects of heavy metals (Baker 1978), the soil envi-
ronment at Kazan Falls would be less toxic than at
Ferguson Lake for a given level of Cu in the soil.
The lower accumulation levels and the threshold
response in V. uliginosun at Ferguson Lake may be
products of the environment inhibiting metabolic
processes, which directly or indirectly affects nu-
trient uptake. This comparison of results illustrates
the importance of site-specific information in de-
termining plant-soil relationships.
Conclusions
Vaccirzi~ltn
uliginosum, a common element of the
low arctic flora, accumulates Cu and U in propor-
tion to levels in the soil with maximal accumulation
levels for each element being more than 1000 times
higher than background concentrations. The high
plant tissue levels result from metal uptake from
soils containing metals released by weathering of
glacially dispersed ore minerals. The train of gla-
cially dispersed material is not detectable in soil or
plant material at distances greater than 1000 m from
the source rocks; however, the high correlation
between plant and soil levels of metals suggests that
in areas where dispersal of heavy metals is
significant, V. ~lliginosumwill accumulate Cu and
U to high levels. Rencz (1979) has also shown that
V. uliginos~lrnwill accumulate anomalous levels of
Pb, Zn, Ni, and Fe where these metals are enriched
in glacially derived sediments.
In the arctic, till has proven to be an effective
sampling medium in mineral exploration; con-
sequently, the ability of V. uliginosurn to reflect
heavy metal levels in till favors the species as a tool
in mineral exploration. The advantages and disad-
vantages of biogeochemical prospecting using V.
~lliginosurn
and other arctic plants versus conven-
tional geochemical techniques have been consid-
ered (Warren and Delavault 1955; Rencz 1979).One
important advantage of plant sampling is that data
significant to the cycling of potentially toxic metals
in food chains is gathered along with data useful in
prospecting. We suggest that plant tissue and till are
effective sampling media in mineral exploration in
the arctic.
