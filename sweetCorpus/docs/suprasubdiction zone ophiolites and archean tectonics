The internal structure and geochemistry
of many Phanerozoic ophiolites show a com-
plex pattern of igneous accretion that involved
multiple stages and sources of melt evolution
and life cycles in suprasubduction zone (SSZ)
environments (Shervais, 2001; Dilek and
Flower, 2003). Some of the most extensively
studied Tethyan ophiolites appear to have
developed, for example, in arc-forearc settings
within restricted marginal basins, which were
nested in older, preexisting oceans (Ishikawa
et al., 2002; Dilek et al., 2008). The subduc-
tion of the ocean floor in these older basins,
combined with slab rollback processes, facili-
tated ophiolite development in the extending
upper plate within relatively short time spans
(<10 m.y.). The SSZ ophiolites generated
during these arc-trench rollback cycles com-
monly have structurally and geochemically
heterogeneous crustal components attesting to
the progressive evolution of their mantle melt
sources. We discuss here that SSZ ophiolites,
albeit with different internal structure and stra-
tigraphy, are part of Archean greenstone belts,
suggesting the operation of plate tectonic–like
processes as early as 3.8 Ga in the Archean.
The Middle Jurassic Mirdita ophiolite (MO)
in northern Albania contains a ~12-km-thick
oceanic lithosphere with SSZ affinity. Dif-
ferent dike generations and lava units within
the sheeted dike complex and in the extrusive
sequence of the MO show a geochemical pro-
gression from older mid-oceanic ridge basalts
(MORB) and basaltic andesites to younger
dikes and lavas with compositions of basaltic
andesite, andesite, dacite, and rhyolite. These
more evolved rocks display island arc tholeiite
(IAT) signatures characterized by progressive
depletion in increasingly incompatible ele-
ments. Even younger dikes and lavas higher
in the sequence have boninitic compositions,
suggesting that their magmas were produced
from partial melting of highly depleted, ultra-
refractory harzburgites (Dilek et al., 2008).
These late-stage dike and lava rocks show
enrichment in the most-incompatible elements
that likely resulted from subduction-derived
fluids and from partial melting of subducted
sediments (Plank and Langmuir, 1998).
The ~12–15-km-thick Cretaceous Semail
ophiolite in Oman has a pseudostratigraphy

reminiscent of fast-spreading modern oceanic
lithosphere. Similar to the other SSZ Tethyan
ophiolites, the Semail ophiolite also shows mul-
tiple stages of igneous accretion of its crustal
units with different geochemical fingerprints
(Alabaster et al., 1982). The layered gabbros,
the majority of the sheeted dikes, and the basal-
tic pillow lavas of the lower extrusive sequence
(Geotimes Unit) appear to have had common
parental magmas with MORB-like geochemis-
try (Alabaster et al., 1982; Godard et al., 2003).
These MORB-like plutonic and sheeted dike
rocks are intruded by late-stage calc-alkaline
plutons, and the basaltic Geotimes unit is over-
lain by pillowed to massive lava flows with
basaltic andesite, dacite, and rhyolite composi-
tions, making up the younger Lasail and Alley
Units. The youngest dikes and lavas in the Alley
Unit, some of the late-stage ultramafic intru-
sions in the lower crust, and harzburgitic host
peridotites with orthopyroxenite dikes all have
boninitic compositions, representing refrac-
tory magma series derived from high degrees
of partial melting of a depleted mantle source
(Ishikawa et al., 2002; Tamura and Arai, 2006).
These geological and geochemical features indi-
cate a progressive evolution of the Semail mag-
mas from initial MORB-like to IAT tholeiites to
boninites through time.
SSZ ophiolites with similar crustal architec-
ture and geochemical features as in the Tethyan
ophiolites are common in the Neoproterozoic
record (Kusky, 2004). Whether the Archean
record of Earth’s crustal evolution includes
SSZ ophiolites, however, remains a fundamen-
tal question because of its strong implications
for the operation of modern plate tectonics
in deeptime. The Archean greenstone belts,
which contain widespread mafic-ultramafic
rock assemblages, are likely candidates for
including ophiolites. Some researchers, how-
ever, interpret them as anastomosing networks
of synforms consisting of dense lavas that
were caught up between diapiric batholiths
and associated felsic crust (Hamilton, 2003).
The origin of voluminous Archean komatiite-
tholeiitic basalt association has been attributed
to anomalously hot mantle plumes and much
higher mantle temperatures and melting condi-
tions than those in the Phanerozoic (Herzberg,
2004; Smithies et al., 2005). Such conditions in
the Archean Earth are thought to have created
crust that was far too hot, weak, and mobile
to behave as rigid plates and to permit rise of
dense melts (Hamilton, 2003).
Based on their geochemical similarities to
Phanerozoic boninites, however, recent stud-
ies suggest subduction zone origin of some of
the Archean komatiites (Parman et al., 2001).
Furthermore, garnet-albite-bearing mineral
assemblages found in supracrustal amphibolites
from the mid-Archean Barberton greenstone-
granitoid terrain reveal pressures of 1.2–1.5 GPa
at temperatures of 600–650 °C, and signal high-
pressure, low-temperature metamorphic condi-
tions reminiscent of modern subduction zones
(Moyen et al., 2006). This discovery suggests
that lithospheric subduction was operating as
early as 3.2 Ga. The reported occurrence of
boninites, picrites, adakites, Mg-andesites, and
Nb-enriched basalts, all subduction related, in
the 3.8–2.5 Ga greenstone belts also supports
the operation of modern convergent margin tec-
tonics in the Archean (Smithies et al., 2007).
Given the occurrence of subduction-related
volcanic rocks and metamorphic assemblages
in the Archean geology, SSZ ophiolites should
be found within greenstone belts. A careful
examination of some of the Archean green-
stone belts indeed shows that they represent
highly deformed and dismantled SSZ ophio-
lites. Eo-to-Mesoarchean greenstone belts in
southwest Greenland (e.g., 3800–3700 Ma Isua,
ca. ~3075 Ma Ivisaartoq, 3070 Ma Ujarassuit)
are composed mainly of metavolcanic rocks,
metagabbros, and ultramafic rocks associated
with metapelites, chert, banded iron formation
(BIF), and felsic rocks. The Isua greenstone belt
contains a sheeted dike complex locally grading
upward into pillow lavas (Furnes et al., 2007).
Both the sheeted dikes and pillow lavas in Isua
display similar concentrations of incompatible
elements and their ratios, suggesting that they
are cogenetic. Compositionally, volcanic rocks
in both the Isua and Ivisaartoq greenstone belts
are dominantly tholeiitic basalts, boninites, and
picrites, with minor intermediate-to-felsic vol-
canic rocks (Polat et al., 2008). Trace element
characteristics of the Archean metavolcanics are
comparable to those of the ultramafic-to-mafic
volcanic rocks occurring in modern subduction
systems (e.g., Izu-Bonin-Mariana) and in the
Phanerozoic ophiolites, displaying similar geo-
chemical trends as discussed earlier.
These examples demonstrate that a hybrid
mixture of MORB-like and arc-like element sig-
