Abstract
Sediment transport and deposition in sand±gravel bed rivers is shown to depend on dunes. The sediment mixture is vertically
sorted in avalanches at the lee side of the dunes. Part of the resulting upward ®ning sets of the largest dunes that occur during a
discharge wave, is preserved in the bed. Furthermore the sediment is entrained and deposited size selectively in the dune
troughs, which results in an additional upward ®ning accumulation of lag deposits. This deposit is the source for sediment
entrained during the next discharge wave, which will depend on the relict vertical sorting and on the depth from which it is
entrained. The entrainment and deposition depth of the sediment depends on the dune trough level below the average bed level
and therefore on the dune height. Thus subsequent discharge waves of decreasing magnitude will leave the upward ®ning cross-
bedded sets at depths below the bed surface related to the concurrent dune height. This is demonstrated with  ̄ume experiments
and with new vibrocores collected from the river Waal (The Netherlands). q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
In a number of recent publications it was estab-
lished that sediment transport in sand±gravel bed
rivers cannot be understood without considering the
different sediment sizes and their interactions (e.g.
Klaassen, 1991; Wilcock, 1993). The sorting in the
bed was modelled in two layers by Ribberink
(1987), but neither the historic sorting of previous
discharge waves, nor the sorting within dunes were
incorporated. Recently Parker et al. (2000) developed
a mathematical model concept with a continuous
description of sediment sorting in the dunes and the

bed, but could not implement it, because a general
predictor for the sediment sorting in depth was
unavailable. This paper is a ®rst step towards such a
predictor.
A well known feature of dunes in rivers is the cross-
bedded deposit, resulting from avalanching of
bedload sediment at the lee side of a dune during
propagation. Within a cross-bedded set, that is, in a
lee side avalanche, the sediment is sorted vertically
(see Fig. 1). The gravel is mainly deposited on the
lower half of the lee slope, while the ®ner grades
are predominantly deposited in the upper half. The
result is an upward ®ning deposit with cross-bedding.
Although this sorting principle related to avalanch-
ing is well known, a mathematical description of the
process is not yet available. Bagnold (1954) proposed
semi-empirical relations describing the velocity of the

avalanche in air. He derived that the stress distribution
within the thin layer of each avalanche promotes a
coarsening upward of the sediment within each
stratum, allowing the coarse sediment to roll down
further. In more viscous  ̄uids like water, this sorting
may to some extent be counteracted because of pore
tension. Nevertheless, Allen (1963, 1970), Boersma

emphasis on the role of dunes in two subsequent discharge waves in

gravel layers are shown) is as described in Fig. 1. The smaller dunes

wave, and leave a comparable but less deep vertical sorting.
et al. (1968) and Kleinhans (2000) and many others
found a distinct upward ®ning within subaqueous
dunes.
During the different stages of discharge waves,
particle size-selective entrainment and deposition of
the sediment mixture may also lead to a vertical sort-
ing. The largest grains that are in motion during the
peak discharge will be deposited in the dune troughs
during falling discharge, while the smaller grains
remain in transport, resulting in an upward ®ning
accumulation of lag deposits without cross-bedding,
produced by successive dunes during a waning  ̄ood.
Obviously the process of sorting in avalanches at the
lee side of dunes cooperates with the selective trans-
port process to create an upward ®ning sorting of
sediment that is preserved in the river bed (see Fig. 1).
The objective here is to explore the role of the two
types of sediment sorting in the transport and deposi-
tion processes, speci®cally for the case of sand±gravel
bed sediment in two subsequent discharge waves in
the river Rhine and Waal (The Netherlands).
2. Conceptual model of sediment transport and
deposition
The size selective sediment transport process and
the sediment sorting process within the dunes can be
combined into a new conceptual model (see Fig. 2),
explaining the sediment transport during a discharge
wave and the resulting deposits.
During rising  ̄ow the bed level (de®ned here as the
level of bedform troughs) is lowered while sediment is
entrained into the migrating and growing bedforms.
During waning  ̄ow, the bed level rises again while
the bedforms become smaller. Meanwhile, the sedi-
ment is vertically sorted in the grain avalanches along
the lee side of bedforms, and due to selective entrain-
ment and deposition of the largest grains in the dune
troughs in the waning  ̄ow. Thus the river bed after a
discharge wave will show both upward ®ning in sets
and in an accumulation of lag deposits (see Figs. 1
and 2).
The bedform height determines, from which depth
below the initial bed level the bed sediment is
entrained. Thus in different stages of the discharge
wave, the bed sediment available for transport is
derived from different layers in the bed. Due to the

Fig. 3. Vertical sorting measured in the dunes in the  ̄ume experi-
ments (Kleinhans, 2000), expressed as the gravel fraction in the
sediment (Dgravel . 2 mm, rest is sand). The depth of the dune
troughs (and armour layers in T5 and T7) are given as circles.
The gravel fraction clearly decreases to the dune top (upward
®ning). For T9 there is also a relict upward ®ning deposit below
the dune trough level, which consists of relict cross-bedding and the
accumulation of lag deposits (see Fig. 1).
upward ®ning, the bedload transport in waning  ̄ow is
sandier and therefore relatively larger than it would
have been without the vertical sorting. The composi-
tion of the entrained bed sediment must be predicted
(Kleinhans, 2000) with the vertical sorting of the
largest previous discharge wave (in the last 10±
20 yr) as a boundary condition or history effect. In
addition, the maximum bedform height determines
the depth of lowest level of gravel deposition in the
bed, which yields a prediction of the deposits in the
bed.
These are new extensions of the work of Klaassen
(1987) and Klaassen et al. (1987), which could be
applied in a model like the one described by Parker
et al. (2000). The deposits sampled with recently
collected vibrocores demonstrate that the remanants
of vertical sorting in these discharge waves can be
identi®ed. Recent sediment transport measurements
indicate that the sorted deposits have large effects
on the sediment transport and its grain size
distribution.
3. Sorting in laboratory  ̄ume
Three  ̄ume experiments have recently been carried
9
out with sand±gravel sediment in a  ̄ume, 50 m long
and 1.5 m wide (T5, T7 and T9 in Blom and Klein-
hans 1999; Kleinhans 2000). Uniform  ̄ow conditions
were maintained and the transported sediment was
recirculated. The ®rst and third experiments had
approximately the same  ̄ow conditions (0.7 m/s),
while the second had a larger  ̄ow velocity (0.8 m/
s). The bed was not remixed after the ®rst and second
experiments but was allowed to develop further from
the previous condition.
In the ®rst experiment, size-selective entrainment
led to the formation of a coarse layer (at the level of
dune troughs) or armour layer below the propagating
bedforms. Furthermore the sediment was vertically
sorted in the dunes due to avalanching (see Fig. 3).
The second experiment had higher dunes, while the
armour at the level of the troughs was lowered due to
entrainment of bed sediment into the dunes. In the
third experiment, the largest particles became immo-
bile, leading to deposition in the bedform troughs.
Thus, the armour layer of the previous experiment
was buried below ®ning upward lag deposits of
gravel. The sediment transport in the third experiment
was 15% higher than in the ®rst, while the fraction of
gravel in the third was about the same factor lower.
These experiments illustrate the importance of the
history of the bed for both sediment transport and
deposits. Under the high shear stress of the second
experiment, much more sand and gravel was entrained
from the bed below the armour layer than in the ®rst
experiment. This sediment thus still was available for
transport in the third experiment, leading to a more
sandier bedload transport than in the ®rst, even though
the bed shear stress was the same. The experiments
showed that an accumulation of the upward ®ning lag
deposits is left in the bed, that re ̄ects the level of the
troughs of the highest dunes in the recent past. The
whole bed above this lag shows an upward ®ning
cross-bedded set.
4. Sorting in rivers Waal and Bovenrijn
Field measurements were carried out in the rivers
Waal and Bovenrijn, immediately downstream and
upstream respectively of the bifurcation point Panner-
densche Kop, during a large discharge wave in 1998
and an extreme one in 1995 (Kleinhans, 2000). These
10

are large sand±gravel bed rivers with D50  2 mm
(median diameter) and D90  12 mm. The bedload
transport was sampled with a Helley Smith type
sampler and the dune dimensions were obtained
from three dimensional echo soundings, as well as
bedload transport by dune-tracking.
The maximum bedform height in the Waal was
0.55 m in 1998. The maximum bedform height in
the Bovenrijn was 1.00 m in 1998 and 1.45 m in
1995. In 1995 no echo soundings were taken in the
Waal but from the measurements in 1993 at more or
less the same discharge peak a dune height range of
0.7±1.4 m is obtained. The discharge waves of 1995
and 1998 are the only waves that took place in the
period 1995±2000, in which dunes higher than 0.3 m
occurred.
The transport rate and trends determined with both
dune-tracking and the bedload sampler show the same
trend of low transport at rising  ̄ow (in the order of
10 m 2/day) and large transport at falling  ̄ow (in the
order of 15 m 2/day). The bedload at rising  ̄ow
consisted of 60% sand and 40% gravel, while it
became sandier during the discharge wave, with the
sand content rising to 75% near the end of the
discharge wave.
In the cross-section, 7 vibrocores were collected at
distances off the river axis of 140, 100, 50 and 0 m in
the Bovenrijn, and 100, 67, 33 and 0 in the Waal
(NITG, 2000). In the Bovenrijn, this was done in 5
cross-sections and in the Waal in 6 cross-sections, all
400 m apart. Particle size analysis was carried out for
samples taken from the cores, usually at 0.6±0.8 m
and at 1.6±1.8 m below the bed surface.
5. Discussion
Dunes are approximately triangular bed level  ̄uc-
tuations around an average bed level. Thus, the tops
are 0.5 times the dune height above the average bed
level, and the troughs are 0.5 times the dune height
below the average, or a little deeper for real, slightly
11
convex dunes. The coarse layers (see Fig. 2) are thus
predicted at 0.5 times the dune height below the top of
the vibrocores, which is at depths of 0.5 and 0.8 m for
the Bovenrijn in 1998 and 1995 respectively and of
0.3 and about 0.6 m for the Waal.
Comparison with the depth of the gravel deposits in
the vibrocores shows that these predictions are correct
(see Fig. 4). In de Bovenrijn an additional coarse layer
occurs frequently at a depth between 0.1 and 0.2 m.
This is probably the historic sorting of a small
discharge wave in 1999 which might have caused
dunes with a height of, say, 0.3 m. In some cores,
remnants of cross-bedding were recognized, which
con®rms that part of the upward ®ning in the bed is
the relict of the sorting in the avalanches. Armouring
was also observed: the deposits are capped by a coarse
layer in many places (see Fig. 4).
The upward ®ning trend is less easy to show in the
®eld data, because the cores were sampled for sieving
at more or less ®xed depths, thus often overlapping
both the coarse and ®ne layers. About six samples
could be found that represented only the coarse layers
of 1995 or only the ®ne layers of 1995. For the ®ne
layer, the gravel fraction is 43%, and for the coarse, it
is 59%, which is a considerable upward ®ning. These
®ndings corroborate the conceptual model.
To indicate the relevance of the model presented
here, two preliminary calculations are given. The ®rst
is a prediction of the critical grain size in peak  ̄ow
and in waning  ̄ow in the Waal in 1998 and in the
 ̄ume experiments, to demonstrate which part of the
transported sediment is deposited. The second is a
prediction of the sediment transport in peak  ̄ow
and waning  ̄ow, with and without an assumed verti-
cal sorting, to demonstrate the effect of sorting on the
transport.
The critical grain size can be predicted by compar-
ing the measured shear stress on the grains with the
critical shear stress of all grain sizes in the mixture. To
obtain the latter, the Shields critical shear stress for
the D50 of the bed sediment is corrected for hiding
(small grains) and exposure (large grains) effects
Fig. 4. Observations of the deposits in the river (a) Bovenrijn (b) en Waal. The depths of the basis of ®ning upward deposits (or gravel layers)
was measured in a large number of vibrocores, of which a few examples are given. The gravel layers at the bed surface are armour layers, while
the lower gravel layers are interpreted as the bases of relict cross-bedding and lag deposits (see Fig. 1). The depths of trough levels have been
predicted with the observed dune height during the discharge waves of 1995 and 1998, and agree with the observed depths of the gravel layers
(see Fig. 2). In addition the top depths of sand deposits are given.

with the equation of Egiazaroff (1965), details and
discussion on reliability given in Kleinhans and Van
Rijn (2001), yielding the critical stresses for all grain
sizes. The results are given in Table 1. Almost all
particle sizes are still in transport according to these
calculations, except for experiment T9. This means
that only in T9 the coarsest sediment was deposited
in the troughs due to selective transport, while in the
Waal the selective deposition may have been rela-
tively unimportant and thus the vertical sorting by
the bedforms must have played a larger role.
The effect of vertical sorting is assessed with a
prediction of the bedload transport based on the
conceptual model given in Figs. 2 and 3 applied to
the river Waal in 1998. The predictions are done with
a slightly adapted (Meyer-Peter and Mueller, 1948)
predictor (Kleinhans and Van Rijn, 2001). The input
sediment available for transport changes as the dune
height diminishes, assuming an upward ®ning sorting
in the bed. The D50 of the sediment available for trans-
port is based on the particle size distributions that
describe the vertical sorting in the  ̄ume experiments,
and on which Fig. 4 also was based. It appeared that
the D50 of the sediment in the whole dune (sediment
available for transport at peak  ̄ow) was twice as large
as in the top half of the dune (sediment available
afterwards for lower  ̄ow). As a reference, the predic-
tion was also done for the case in which the sediment
does not change. The effect of neglecting the relict
vertical sorting is that the predicted bedload transport
is both too small and too coarse (see Table 2), as
expected.
6. Conclusions
Alluvial bedload transport and deposition of sand±
gravel mixtures are strongly coupled to the dune
development and the (historic) sorting of sediment
in the avalanche at the lee side of dunes, as well as
selective deposition in the dune troughs. New empiri-
cal results clearly indicate that the vertical sorting
leaves a recognizable deposit in the riverbed at a
depth depending on the maximum dune height of
the concurrent discharge wave. Preliminary calcula-
tions show that both the vertical sorting due to
avalanching and due to selective deposition have a
large effect on the sediment transport and deposition
of sand±gravel sediment, which is con®rmed with
empirical results.

Predicted sediment transport in the Waal in 1998. The effect of vertical sorting is modelled as a decrease of the D50 of the bed sediment, which is
used in the bedload transport prediction. For comparison, the case without the sorting effect is also given. Incorporating vertical sorting leads to
higher bedload transport in waning  ̄ow than without vertical sorting
