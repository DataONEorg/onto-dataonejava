Starting from the raw OCR data, I first removed all of the phrases and words containing punctuation marks (except for words that end with "'s") from the full compendium in order to create the raw single word compendium.  To condense different conjugations of the same word, I used the Porter2 Stemmer to stem each headword and synonym, condensed all headwords and pairings with matching stems and part-of-speech, and then annotated the stemmed pairings using the shortest unstemmed version of the word.
